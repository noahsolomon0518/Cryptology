chapter i  a shifting reef  the year  was signalised by a remarkable incident a mysterious and puzzling phenomenon which doubtless no one has yet forgotten not to mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the public mind even in the interior of continents seafaring men were particularly excited  merchants common sailors captains of vessels skippers both of europe and america naval officers of all countries and the governments of several states on the two continents were deeply interested in the matter  for some time past vessels had been met by an enormous thing a long object spindleshaped occasionally phosphorescent and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale  the facts relating to this apparition entered in various logbooks agreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in question the untiring rapidity of its movements its surprising power of locomotion and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed  if it was a whale it surpassed in size all those hitherto classified in science taking into consideration the mean of observations made at divers times rejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to this object a length of two hundred feet equally with the exaggerated opinions which set it down as a mile in width and three in lengthwe might fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all dimensions admitted by the learned ones of the day if it existed at all and that it did exist was an undeniable fact and with that tendency which disposes the human mind in favour of the marvellous we can understand the excitement produced in the entire world by this supernatural apparition as to classing it in the list of fables the idea was out of the question  on the 0th of july  the steamer governor higginson of the calcutta and burnach steam navigation company had met this moving mass five miles off the east coast of australia captain baker thought at first that he was in the presence of an unknown sandbank he even prepared to determine its exact position when two columns of water projected by the mysterious object shot with a hissing noise a hundred and fifty feet up into the air now unless the sandbank had been submitted to the intermittent eruption of a geyser the governor higginson had to do neither more nor less than with an aquatic mammal unknown till then which threw up from its blowholes columns of water mixed with air and vapour  similar facts were observed on the rd of july in the same year in the pacific ocean by the columbus of the west india and pacific steam navigation company  but this extraordinary creature could transport itself from one place to another with surprising velocity as in an interval of three days the governor higginson and the columbus had observed it at two different points of the chart separated by a distance of more than seven hundred nautical leagues  fifteen days later two thousand miles farther off the helvetia of the compagnienationale and the shannon of the royal mail steamship company sailing to windward in that portion of the atlantic lying between the united states and europe respectively signalled the monster to each other in   n lat and 0  w long  in these simultaneous observations they thought themselves justified in estimating the minimum length of the mammal at more than three hundred and fifty feet as the shannon and helvetia were of smaller dimensions than it though they measured three hundred feet over all  now the largest whales those which frequent those parts of the sea round the aleutian kulammak and umgullich islands have never exceeded the length of sixty yards if they attain that  in every place of great resort the monster was the fashion they sang of it in the cafes ridiculed it in the papers and represented it on the stage  all kinds of stories were circulated regarding it there appeared in the papers caricatures of every gigantic and imaginary creature from the white whale the terrible moby dick of subarctic regions to the immense kraken whose tentacles could entangle a ship of five hundred tons and hurry it into the abyss of the ocean the legends of ancient times were even revived  then burst forth the unending argument between the believers and the unbelievers in the societies of the wise and the scientific journals the question of the monster inflamed all minds  editors of scientific journals quarrelling with believers in the supernatural spilled seas of ink during this memorable campaign some even drawing blood for from the seaserpent they came to direct personalities  during the first months of the year  the question seemed buried never to revive when new facts were brought before the public it was then no longer a scientific problem to be solved but a real danger seriously to be avoided  the question took quite another shape the monster became a small island a rock a reef but a reef of indefinite and shifting proportions  on the th of march  the moravian of the montreal ocean company finding herself during the night in  0 lat  and   long struck on her starboard quarter a rock marked in no chart for that part of the sea under the combined efforts of the wind and its four hundred horse power it was going at the rate of thirteen knots  had it not been for the superior strength of the hull of the moravian she would have been broken by the shock and gone down with the  passengers she was bringing home from canada  the accident happened about five oclock in the morning as the day was breaking  the officers of the quarterdeck hurried to the afterpart of the vessel  they examined the sea with the most careful attention they saw nothing but a strong eddy about three cables length distant as if the surface had been violently agitated  the bearings of the place were taken exactly and the moravian continued its route without apparent damage had it struck on a submerged rock or on an enormous wreck  they could not tell but on examination of the ships bottom when undergoing repairs it was found that part of her keel was broken  this fact so grave in itself might perhaps have been forgotten like many others if three weeks after it had not been reenacted under similar circumstances  but thanks to the nationality of the victim of the shock thanks to the reputation of the company to which the vessel belonged the circumstance became extensively circulated  the th of april  the sea being beautiful the breeze favourable the scotia of the cunard companys line found herself in   long and   lat  she was going at the speed of thirteen knots and a half  at seventeen minutes past four in the afternoon whilst the passengers were assembled at lunch in the great saloon a slight shock was felt on the hull of the scotia on her quarter a little aft of the portpaddle  the scotia had not struck but she had been struck and seemingly by something rather sharp and penetrating than blunt the shock had been so slight that no one had been alarmed had it not been for the shouts of the carpenters watch who rushed on to the bridge exclaiming we are sinking we are sinking  at first the passengers were much frightened but captain anderson hastened to reassure them  the danger could not be imminent  the scotia divided into seven compartments by strong partitions could brave with impunity any leak captain anderson went down immediately into the hold he found that the sea was pouring into the fifth compartment and the rapidity of the influx proved that the force of the water was considerable  fortunately this compartment did not hold the boilers or the fires would have been immediately extinguished captain anderson ordered the engines to be stopped at once and one of the men went down to ascertain the extent of the injury some minutes afterwards they discovered the existence of a large hole two yards in diameter in the ships bottom such a leak could not be stopped and the scotia her paddles half submerged was obliged to continue her course  she was then three hundred miles from cape clear and after three days delay which caused great uneasiness in liverpool she entered the basin of the company  the engineers visited the scotia which was put in dry dock they could scarcely believe it possible at two yards and a half below watermark was a regular rent in the form of an isosceles triangle the broken place in the iron plates was so perfectly defined that it could not have been more neatly done by a punch it was clear then that the instrument producing the perforation was not of a common stamp and after having been driven with prodigious strength and piercing an iron plate   inches thick had withdrawn itself by a backward motion  such was the last fact which resulted in exciting once more the torrent of public opinion  from this moment all unlucky casualties which could not be otherwise accounted for were put down to the monster  upon this imaginary creature rested the responsibility of all these shipwrecks which unfortunately were considerable for of three thousand ships whose loss was annually recorded at lloyds the number of sailing and steamships supposed to be totally lost from the absence of all news amounted to not less than two hundred  now it was the monster who justly or unjustly was accused of their disappearance and thanks to it communication between the different continents became more and more dangerous the public demanded sharply that the seas should at any price be relieved from this formidable cetacean  []  [] member of the whale family    chapter ii  pro and con  at the period when these events took place i had just returned from a scientific research in the disagreeable territory of nebraska in the united states  in virtue of my office as assistant professor in the museum of natural history in paris the french government had attached me to that expedition after six months in nebraska i arrived in new york towards the end of march laden with a precious collection my departure for france was fixed for the first days in may meanwhile i was occupying myself in classifying my mineralogical botanical and zoological riches when the accident happened to the scotia  i was perfectly up in the subject which was the question of the day how could i be otherwise  i had read and reread all the american and european papers without being any nearer a conclusion this mystery puzzled me  under the impossibility of forming an opinion i jumped from one extreme to the other that there really was something could not be doubted and the incredulous were invited to put their finger on the wound of the scotia  on my arrival at new york the question was at its height the theory of the floating island and the unapproachable sandbank supported by minds little competent to form a judgment was abandoned and indeed unless this shoal had a machine in its stomach how could it change its position with such astonishing rapidity  from the same cause the idea of a floating hull of an enormous wreck was given up  there remained then only two possible solutions of the question which created two distinct parties  on one side those who were for a monster of colossal strength on the other those who were for a submarine vessel of enormous motive power  but this last theory plausible as it was could not stand against inquiries made in both worlds  that a private gentleman should have such a machine at his command was not likely  where when and how was it built and how could its construction have been kept secret certainly a government might possess such a destructive machine and in these disastrous times when the ingenuity of man has multiplied the power of weapons of war it was possible that without the knowledge of others a state might try to work such a formidable engine  but the idea of a war machine fell before the declaration of governments as public interest was in question and transatlantic communications suffered their veracity could not be doubted  but how admit that the construction of this submarine boat had escaped the public eye for a private gentleman to keep the secret under such circumstances would be very difficult and for a state whose every act is persistently watched by powerful rivals certainly impossible  upon my arrival in new york several persons did me the honour of consulting me on the phenomenon in question i had published in france a work in quarto in two volumes entitled mysteries of the great submarine grounds  this book highly approved of in the learned world gained for me a special reputation in this rather obscure branch of natural history my advice was asked  as long as i could deny the reality of the fact i confined myself to a decided negative but soon finding myself driven into a corner i was obliged to explain myself point by point  i discussed the question in all its forms politically and scientifically and i give here an extract from a carefullystudied article which i published in the number of the 0th of april it ran as follows  after examining one by one the different theories rejecting all other suggestions it becomes necessary to admit the existence of a marine animal of enormous power  the great depths of the ocean are entirely unknown to us soundings cannot reach them  what passes in those remote depths what beings live or can live twelve or fifteen miles beneath the surface of the waterswhat is the organisation of these animals we can scarcely conjecture  however the solution of the problem submitted to me may modify the form of the dilemma  either we do know all the varieties of beings which people our planet or we do not if we do not know them allif nature has still secrets in the deeps for us nothing is more conformable to reason than to admit the existence of fishes or cetaceans of other kinds or even of new species of an organisation formed to inhabit the strata inaccessible to soundings and which an accident of some sort has brought at long intervals to the upper level of the ocean  if on the contrary we do know all living kinds we must necessarily seek for the animal in question amongst those marine beings already classed and in that case i should be disposed to admit the existence of a gigantic narwhal  the common narwhal or unicorn of the sea often attains a length of sixty feet  increase its size fivefold or tenfold give it strength proportionate to its size lengthen its destructive weapons and you obtain the animal required it will have the proportions determined by the officers of the shannon the instrument required by the perforation of the scotia and the power necessary to pierce the hull of the steamer  indeed the narwhal is armed with a sort of ivory sword a halberd according to the expression of certain naturalists the principal tusk has the hardness of steel  some of these tusks have been found buried in the bodies of whales which the unicorn always attacks with success  others have been drawn out not without trouble from the bottoms of ships which they had pierced through and through as a gimlet pierces a barrel the museum of the faculty of medicine of paris possesses one of these defensive weapons two yards and a quarter in length and fifteen inches in diameter at the base  very well suppose this weapon to be six times stronger and the animal ten times more powerful launch it at the rate of twenty miles an hour and you obtain a shock capable of producing the catastrophe required until further information therefore i shall maintain it to be a seaunicorn of colossal dimensions armed not with a halberd but with a real spur as the armoured frigates or the `rams of war whose massiveness and motive power it would possess at the same time thus may this puzzling phenomenon be explained unless there be something over and above all that one has ever conjectured seen perceived or experienced which is just within the bounds of possibility  these last words were cowardly on my part but up to a certain point i wished to shelter my dignity as professor and not give too much cause for laughter to the americans who laugh well when they do laugh  i reserved for myself a way of escape in effect however i admitted the existence of the monster my article was warmly discussed which procured it a high reputation it rallied round it a certain number of partisans  the solution it proposed gave at least full liberty to the imagination the human mind delights in grand conceptions of supernatural beings and the sea is precisely their best vehicle the only medium through which these giants against which terrestrial animals such as elephants or rhinoceroses are as nothing can be produced or developed  the industrial and commercial papers treated the question chiefly from this point of view  the shipping and mercantile gazette the lloyds list the packetboat and the maritime and colonial review all papers devoted to insurance companies which threatened to raise their rates of premium were unanimous on this point  public opinion had been pronounced the united states were the first in the field and in new york they made preparations for an expedition destined to pursue this narwhal a frigate of great speed the abraham lincoln was put in commission as soon as possible  the arsenals were opened to commander farragut who hastened the arming of his frigate but as it always happens the moment it was decided to pursue the monster the monster did not appear for two months no one heard it spoken of  no ship met with it it seemed as if this unicorn knew of the plots weaving around it it had been so much talked of even through the atlantic cable that jesters pretended that this slender fly had stopped a telegram on its passage and was making the most of it  so when the frigate had been armed for a long campaign and provided with formidable fishing apparatus no one could tell what course to pursue impatience grew apace when on the nd of july they learned that a steamer of the line of san francisco from california to shanghai had seen the animal three weeks before in the north pacific ocean the excitement caused by this news was extreme  the ship was revictualled and well stocked with coal  three hours before the abraham lincoln left brooklyn pier i received a letter worded as follows  to m aronnax professor in the museum of paris fifth avenue hotel new york  sirif you will consent to join the abraham lincoln in this expedition the government of the united states will with pleasure see france represented in the enterprise commander farragut has a cabin at your disposal  very cordially yours jb hobson secretary of marine    chapter iii  i form my resolution  three seconds before the arrival of j b hobsons letter i no more thought of pursuing the unicorn than of attempting the passage of the north sea three seconds after reading the letter of the honourable secretary of marine i felt that my true vocation the sole end of my life was to chase this disturbing monster and purge it from the world  but i had just returned from a fatiguing journey weary and longing for repose  i aspired to nothing more than again seeing my country my friends my little lodging by the jardin des plantes my dear and precious collectionsbut nothing could keep me back i forgot allfatigue friends and collectionsand accepted without hesitation the offer of the american government  besides thought i all roads lead back to europe and the unicorn may be amiable enough to hurry me towards the coast of france this worthy animal may allow itself to be caught in the seas of europe for my particular benefit and i will not bring back less than half a yard of his ivory halberd to the museum of natural history but in the meanwhile i must seek this narwhal in the north pacific ocean which to return to france was taking the road to the antipodes  conseil i called in an impatient voice  conseil was my servant a true devoted flemish boy who had accompanied me in all my travels  i liked him and he returned the liking well he was quiet by nature regular from principle zealous from habit evincing little disturbance at the different surprises of life very quick with his hands and apt at any service required of him and despite his name never giving adviceeven when asked for it  conseil had followed me for the last ten years wherever science led never once did he complain of the length or fatigue of a journey never make an objection to pack his portmanteau for whatever country it might be or however far away whether china or congo besides all this he had good health which defied all sickness and solid muscles but no nerves good morals are understood this boy was thirty years old and his age to that of his master as fifteen to twenty  may i be excused for saying that i was forty years old  but conseil had one fault  he was ceremonious to a degree and would never speak to me but in the third person which was sometimes provoking  conseil said i again beginning with feverish hands to make preparations for my departure  certainly i was sure of this devoted boy  as a rule i never asked him if it were convenient for him or not to follow me in my travels but this time the expedition in question might be prolonged and the enterprise might be hazardous in pursuit of an animal capable of sinking a frigate as easily as a nutshell  here there was matter for reflection even to the most impassive man in the world what would conseil say  conseil i called a third time  conseil appeared  did you call sir said he entering  yes my boy make preparations for me and yourself too we leave in two hours  as you please sir replied conseil quietly  not an instant to lose lock in my trunk all travelling utensils coats shirts and stockingswithout counting as many as you can and make haste  and your collections sir observed conseil  they will keep them at the hotel  we are not returning to paris then said conseil  oh certainly i answered evasively by making a curve  will the curve please you sir  oh it will be nothing not quite so direct a road that is all we take our passage in the abraham lincoln  as you think proper sir coolly replied conseil  you see my friend it has to do with the monster the famous narwhal  we are going to purge it from the seas a glorious mission but a dangerous one  we cannot tell where we may go these animals can be very capricious but we will go whether or no we have got a captain who is pretty wideawake  our luggage was transported to the deck of the frigate immediately i hastened on board and asked for commander farragut one of the sailors conducted me to the poop where i found myself in the presence of a goodlooking officer who held out his hand to me  monsieur pierre aronnax said he  himself replied i commander farragut  you are welcome professor your cabin is ready for you  i bowed and desired to be conducted to the cabin destined for me  the abraham lincoln had been well chosen and equipped for her new destination  she was a frigate of great speed fitted with highpressure engines which admitted a pressure of seven atmospheres  under this the abraham lincoln attained the mean speed of nearly eighteen knots and a third an hour a considerable speed but nevertheless insufficient to grapple with this gigantic cetacean  the interior arrangements of the frigate corresponded to its nautical qualities  i was well satisfied with my cabin which was in the after part opening upon the gunroom  we shall be well off here said i to conseil  as well by your honours leave as a hermitcrab in the shell of a whelk said conseil  i left conseil to stow our trunks conveniently away and remounted the poop in order to survey the preparations for departure  at that moment commander farragut was ordering the last moorings to be cast loose which held the abraham lincoln to the pier of brooklyn  so in a quarter of an hour perhaps less the frigate would have sailed without me  i should have missed this extraordinary supernatural and incredible expedition the recital of which may well meet with some suspicion  but commander farragut would not lose a day nor an hour in scouring the seas in which the animal had been sighted he sent for the engineer  is the steam full on asked he  yes sir replied the engineer  go ahead cried commander farragut    chapter iv  ned land  captain farragut was a good seaman worthy of the frigate he commanded his vessel and he were one  he was the soul of it  on the question of the monster there was no doubt in his mind and he would not allow the existence of the animal to be disputed on board  he believed in it as certain good women believe in the leviathanby faith not by reason the monster did exist and he had sworn to rid the seas of it  either captain farragut would kill the narwhal or the narwhal would kill the captain there was no third course  the officers on board shared the opinion of their chief they were ever chatting discussing and calculating the various chances of a meeting watching narrowly the vast surface of the ocean more than one took up his quarters voluntarily in the crosstrees who would have cursed such a berth under any other circumstances as long as the sun described its daily course the rigging was crowded with sailors whose feet were burnt to such an extent by the heat of the deck as to render it unbearable still the abraham lincoln had not yet breasted the suspected waters of the pacific as to the ships company they desired nothing better than to meet the unicorn to harpoon it hoist it on board and despatch it they watched the sea with eager attention  besides captain farragut had spoken of a certain sum of two thousand dollars set apart for whoever should first sight the monster were he cabinboy common seaman or officer  i leave you to judge how eyes were used on board the abraham lincoln  for my own part i was not behind the others and left to no one my share of daily observations  the frigate might have been called the argus for a hundred reasons  only one amongst us conseil seemed to protest by his indifference against the question which so interested us all and seemed to be out of keeping with the general enthusiasm on board  i have said that captain farragut had carefully provided his ship with every apparatus for catching the gigantic cetacean no whaler had ever been better armed  we possessed every known engine from the harpoon thrown by the hand to the barbed arrows of the blunderbuss and the explosive balls of the duckgun on the forecastle lay the perfection of a breechloading gun very thick at the breech and very narrow in the bore the model of which had been in the exhibition of  this precious weapon of american origin could throw with ease a conical projectile of nine pounds to a mean distance of ten miles  thus the abraham lincoln wanted for no means of destruction and what was better still she had on board ned land the prince of harpooners  ned land was a canadian with an uncommon quickness of hand and who knew no equal in his dangerous occupation  skill coolness audacity and cunning he possessed in a superior degree and it must be a cunning whale to escape the stroke of his harpoon  ned land was about forty years of age he was a tall man more than six feet high strongly built grave and taciturn occasionally violent and very passionate when contradicted his person attracted attention but above all the boldness of his look which gave a singular expression to his face  who calls himself canadian calls himself french and little communicative as ned land was i must admit that he took a certain liking for me my nationality drew him to me no doubt  it was an opportunity for him to talk and for me to hear that old language of rabelais which is still in use in some canadian provinces  the harpooners family was originally from quebec and was already a tribe of hardy fishermen when this town belonged to france  little by little ned land acquired a taste for chatting and i loved to hear the recital of his adventures in the polar seas he related his fishing and his combats with natural poetry of expression his recital took the form of an epic poem and i seemed to be listening to a canadian homer singing the iliad of the regions of the north  i am portraying this hardy companion as i really knew him we are old friends now united in that unchangeable friendship which is born and cemented amidst extreme dangers  ah brave ned i ask no more than to live a hundred years longer that i may have more time to dwell the longer on your memory  now what was ned lands opinion upon the question of the marine monster i must admit that he did not believe in the unicorn and was the only one on board who did not share that universal conviction he even avoided the subject which i one day thought it my duty to press upon him  one magnificent evening the 0th july that is to say three weeks after our departure the frigate was abreast of cape blanc thirty miles to leeward of the coast of patagonia we had crossed the tropic of capricorn and the straits of magellan opened less than seven hundred miles to the south  before eight days were over the abraham lincoln would be ploughing the waters of the pacific  seated on the poop ned land and i were chatting of one thing and another as we looked at this mysterious sea whose great depths had up to this time been inaccessible to the eye of man i naturally led up the conversation to the giant unicorn and examined the various chances of success or failure of the expedition but seeing that ned land let me speak without saying too much himself i pressed him more closely  well ned said i is it possible that you are not convinced of the existence of this cetacean that we are following have you any particular reason for being so incredulous  the harpooner looked at me fixedly for some moments before answering struck his broad forehead with his hand a habit of his as if to collect himself and said at last perhaps i have mr aronnax  but ned you a whaler by profession familiarised with all the great marine mammaliayou ought to be the last to doubt under such circumstances  that is just what deceives you professor replied ned as a whaler i have followed many a cetacean harpooned a great number and killed several but however strong or wellarmed they may have been neither their tails nor their weapons would have been able even to scratch the iron plates of a steamer  but ned they tell of ships which the teeth of the narwhal have pierced through and through  wooden shipsthat is possible replied the canadian but i have never seen it done and until further proof i deny that whales cetaceans or seaunicorns could ever produce the effect you describe  well ned i repeat it with a conviction resting on the logic of facts i believe in the existence of a mammal power fully organised belonging to the branch of vertebrata like the whales the cachalots or the dolphins and furnished with a horn of defence of great penetrating power  hum said the harpooner shaking his head with the air of a man who would not be convinced  notice one thing my worthy canadian i resumed if such an animal is in existence if it inhabits the depths of the ocean if it frequents the strata lying miles below the surface of the water it must necessarily possess an organisation the strength of which would defy all comparison  and why this powerful organisation demanded ned  because it requires incalculable strength to keep ones self in these strata and resist their pressure  listen to me let us admit that the pressure of the atmosphere is represented by the weight of a column of water thirtytwo feet high in reality the column of water would be shorter as we are speaking of sea water the density of which is greater than that of fresh water  very well when you dive ned as many times  feet of water as there are above you so many times does your body bear a pressure equal to that of the atmosphere that is to say  lb  for each square inch of its surface it follows then that at 0 feet this pressure equals that of 0 atmospheres of 00 atmospheres at 00 feet and of 000 atmospheres at 000 feet that is about  miles which is equivalent to saying that if you could attain this depth in the ocean each square threeeighths of an inch of the surface of your body would bear a pressure of 00 lb ah my brave ned do you know how many square inches you carry on the surface of your body  i have no idea mr aronnax  about 00 and as in reality the atmospheric pressure is about  lb to the square inch your 00 square inches bear at this moment a pressure of 00 lb  without my perceiving it  without your perceiving it  and if you are not crushed by such a pressure it is because the air penetrates the interior of your body with equal pressure  hence perfect equilibrium between the interior and exterior pressure which thus neutralise each other and which allows you to bear it without inconvenience but in the water it is another thing  yes i understand replied ned becoming more attentive because the water surrounds me but does not penetrate  precisely ned  so that at  feet beneath the surface of the sea you would undergo a pressure of 00 lb at 0 feet ten times that pressure at 00 feet a hundred times that pressure lastly at 000 feet a thousand times that pressure would be 00000 lbthat is to say that you would be flattened as if you had been drawn from the plates of a hydraulic machine  the devil exclaimed ned  very well my worthy harpooner if some vertebrate several hundred yards long and large in proportion can maintain itself in such depths of those whose surface is represented by millions of square inches that is by tens of millions of pounds we must estimate the pressure they undergo consider then what must be the resistance of their bony structure and the strength of their organisation to withstand such pressure  why exclaimed ned land they must be made of iron plates eight inches thick like the armoured frigates  as you say ned  and think what destruction such a mass would cause if hurled with the speed of an express train against the hull of a vessel  yescertainlyperhaps replied the canadian shaken by these figures but not yet willing to give in  well have i convinced you  you have convinced me of one thing sir which is that if such animals do exist at the bottom of the seas they must necessarily be as strong as you say  but if they do not exist mine obstinate harpooner how explain the accident to the scotia    chapter v  at a venture  the voyage of the abraham lincoln was for a long time marked by no special incident  but one circumstance happened which showed the wonderful dexterity of ned land and proved what confidence we might place in him  the 0th of june the frigate spoke some american whalers from whom we learned that they knew nothing about the narwhal but one of them the captain of the monroe knowing that ned land had shipped on board the abraham lincoln begged for his help in chasing a whale they had in sight  commander farragut desirous of seeing ned land at work gave him permission to go on board the monroe and fate served our canadian so well that instead of one whale he harpooned two with a double blow striking one straight to the heart and catching the other after some minutes pursuit  decidedly if the monster ever had to do with ned lands harpoon i would not bet in its favour  the frigate skirted the southeast coast of america with great rapidity the rd of july we were at the opening of the straits of magellan level with cape vierges  but commander farragut would not take a tortuous passage but doubled cape horn  the ships crew agreed with him  and certainly it was possible that they might meet the narwhal in this narrow pass many of the sailors affirmed that the monster could not pass there that he was too big for that  the th of july about three oclock in the afternoon the abraham lincoln at fifteen miles to the south doubled the solitary island this lost rock at the extremity of the american continent to which some dutch sailors gave the name of their native town cape horn the course was taken towards the northwest and the next day the screw of the frigate was at last beating the waters of the pacific  keep your eyes open called out the sailors  and they were opened widely  both eyes and glasses a little dazzled it is true by the prospect of two thousand dollars had not an instants repose  i myself for whom money had no charms was not the least attentive on board  giving but few minutes to my meals but a few hours to sleep indifferent to either rain or sunshine i did not leave the poop of the vessel  now leaning on the netting of the forecastle now on the taffrail i devoured with eagerness the soft foam which whitened the sea as far as the eye could reach and how often have i shared the emotion of the majority of the crew when some capricious whale raised its black back above the waves the poop of the vessel was crowded on a moment  the cabins poured forth a torrent of sailors and officers each with heaving breast and troubled eye watching the course of the cetacean i looked and looked till i was nearly blind whilst conseil kept repeating in a calm voice  if sir you would not squint so much you would see better  but vain excitement  the abraham lincoln checked its speed and made for the animal signalled a simple whale or common cachalot which soon disappeared amidst a storm of abuse  but the weather was good  the voyage was being accomplished under the most favourable auspices  it was then the bad season in australia the july of that zone corresponding to our january in europe but the sea was beautiful and easily scanned round a vast circumference  the 0th of july the tropic of capricorn was cut by 0d of longitude and the th of the same month we crossed the equator on the 0th meridian this passed the frigate took a more decided westerly direction and scoured the central waters of the pacific  commander farragut thought and with reason that it was better to remain in deep water and keep clear of continents or islands which the beast itself seemed to shun perhaps because there was not enough water for him suggested the greater part of the crew the frigate passed at some distance from the marquesas and the sandwich islands crossed the tropic of cancer and made for the china seas  we were on the theatre of the last diversions of the monster  and to say truth we no longer lived on board the entire ships crew were undergoing a nervous excitement of which i can give no idea  they could not eat they could not sleeptwenty times a day a misconception or an optical illusion of some sailor seated on the taffrail would cause dreadful perspirations and these emotions twenty times repeated kept us in a state of excitement so violent that a reaction was unavoidable  and truly reaction soon showed itself  for three months during which a day seemed an age the abraham lincoln furrowed all the waters of the northern pacific running at whales making sharp deviations from her course veering suddenly from one tack to another stopping suddenly putting on steam and backing ever and anon at the risk of deranging her machinery and not one point of the japanese or american coast was left unexplored  the warmest partisans of the enterprise now became its most ardent detractors  reaction mounted from the crew to the captain himself and certainly had it not been for the resolute determination on the part of captain farragut the frigate would have headed due southward this useless search could not last much longer  the abraham lincoln had nothing to reproach herself with she had done her best to succeed never had an american ships crew shown more zeal or patience its failure could not be placed to their chargethere remained nothing but to return  this was represented to the commander  the sailors could not hide their discontent and the service suffered i will not say there was a mutiny on board but after a reasonable period of obstinacy captain farragut as columbus did asked for three days patience  if in three days the monster did not appear the man at the helm should give three turns of the wheel and the abraham lincoln would make for the european seas  this promise was made on the nd of november  it had the effect of rallying the ships crew  the ocean was watched with renewed attention each one wished for a last glance in which to sum up his remembrance glasses were used with feverish activity  it was a grand defiance given to the giant narwhal and he could scarcely fail to answer the summons and appear  two days passed the steam was at half pressure a thousand schemes were tried to attract the attention and stimulate the apathy of the animal in case it should be met in those parts large quantities of bacon were trailed in the wake of the ship to the great satisfaction i must say of the sharks small craft radiated in all directions round the abraham lincoln as she lay to and did not leave a spot of the sea unexplored but the night of the th of november arrived without the unveiling of this submarine mystery  the next day the th of november at twelve the delay would morally speaking expire after that time commander farragut faithful to his promise was to turn the course to the southeast and abandon for ever the northern regions of the pacific  the frigate was then in   n lat  and   e long the coast of japan still remained less than two hundred miles to leeward night was approaching  they had just struck eight bells large clouds veiled the face of the moon then in its first quarter the sea undulated peaceably under the stern of the vessel  at that moment i was leaning forward on the starboard netting conseil standing near me was looking straight before him the crew perched in the ratlines examined the horizon which contracted and darkened by degrees  officers with their night glasses scoured the growing darkness  sometimes the ocean sparkled under the rays of the moon which darted between two clouds then all trace of light was lost in the darkness  in looking at conseil i could see he was undergoing a little of the general influence  at least i thought so  perhaps for the first time his nerves vibrated to a sentiment of curiosity  come conseil said i this is the last chance of pocketing the two thousand dollars  may i be permitted to say sir replied conseil that i never reckoned on getting the prize and had the government of the union offered a hundred thousand dollars it would have been none the poorer  you are right conseil  it is a foolish affair after all and one upon which we entered too lightly  what time lost what useless emotions we should have been back in france six months ago  in your little room sir replied conseil and in your museum sir and i should have already classed all your fossils sir  and the babiroussa would have been installed in its cage in the jardin des plantes and have drawn all the curious people of the capital  as you say conseil  i fancy we shall run a fair chance of being laughed at for our pains  thats tolerably certain replied conseil quietly i think they will make fun of you sir  and must i say it  go on my good friend  well sir you will only get your deserts  indeed  when one has the honour of being a savant as you are sir one should not expose ones self to  conseil had not time to finish his compliment in the midst of general silence a voice had just been heard it was the voice of ned land shouting  look out there  the very thing we are looking for on our weather beam    chapter vi  at full steam  at this cry the whole ships crew hurried towards the harpooner commander officers masters sailors cabin boys even the engineers left their engines and the stokers their furnaces  the order to stop her had been given and the frigate now simply went on by her own momentum  the darkness was then profound and however good the canadians eyes were i asked myself how he had managed to see and what he had been able to see  my heart beat as if it would break but ned land was not mistaken and we all perceived the object he pointed to  at two cables length from the abraham lincoln on the starboard quarter the sea seemed to be illuminated all over it was not a mere phosphoric phenomenon  the monster emerged some fathoms from the water and then threw out that very intense but mysterious light mentioned in the report of several captains  this magnificent irradiation must have been produced by an agent of great shining power the luminous part traced on the sea an immense oval much elongated the centre of which condensed a burning heat whose overpowering brilliancy died out by successive gradations  it is only a massing of phosphoric particles cried one of the officers  no sir certainly not i replied  that brightness is of an essentially electrical nature  besides see see it moves it is moving forwards backwards it is darting towards us  a general cry arose from the frigate  silence said the captain  up with the helm reverse the engines  the steam was shut off and the abraham lincoln beating to port described a semicircle  right the helm go ahead cried the captain  these orders were executed and the frigate moved rapidly from the burning light  i was mistaken  she tried to sheer off but the supernatural animal approached with a velocity double her own  we gasped for breath  stupefaction more than fear made us dumb and motionless  the animal gained on us sporting with the waves it made the round of the frigate which was then making fourteen knots and enveloped it with its electric rings like luminous dust  then it moved away two or three miles leaving a phosphorescent track like those volumes of steam that the express trains leave behind all at once from the dark line of the horizon whither it retired to gain its momentum the monster rushed suddenly towards the abraham lincoln with alarming rapidity stopped suddenly about twenty feet from the hull and died outnot diving under the water for its brilliancy did not abatebut suddenly and as if the source of this brilliant emanation was exhausted  then it reappeared on the other side of the vessel as if it had turned and slid under the hull any moment a collision might have occurred which would have been fatal to us  however i was astonished at the manoeuvres of the frigate she fled and did not attack  on the captains face generally so impassive was an expression of unaccountable astonishment  mr aronnax he said i do not know with what formidable being i have to deal and i will not imprudently risk my frigate in the midst of this darkness  besides how attack this unknown thing how defend ones self from it wait for daylight and the scene will change  you have no further doubt captain of the nature of the animal  no sir it is evidently a gigantic narwhal and an electric one  perhaps added i one can only approach it with a torpedo  undoubtedly replied the captain if it possesses such dreadful power it is the most terrible animal that ever was created that is why sir i must be on my guard  the crew were on their feet all night  no one thought of sleep the abraham lincoln not being able to struggle with such velocity had moderated its pace and sailed at half speed  for its part the narwhal imitating the frigate let the waves rock it at will and seemed decided not to leave the scene of the struggle towards midnight however it disappeared or to use a more appropriate term it died out like a large glowworm had it fled one could only fear not hope it  but at seven minutes to one oclock in the morning a deafening whistling was heard like that produced by a body of water rushing with great violence  the captain ned land and i were then on the poop eagerly peering through the profound darkness  ned land asked the commander you have often heard the roaring of whales  often sir but never such whales the sight of which brought me in two thousand dollars  if i can only approach within four harpoons length of it  but to approach it said the commander i ought to put a whaler at your disposal  certainly sir  that will be trifling with the lives of my men  and mine too simply said the harpooner  towards two oclock in the morning the burning light reappeared not less intense about five miles to windward of the abraham lincoln notwithstanding the distance and the noise of the wind and sea one heard distinctly the loud strokes of the animals tail and even its panting breath  it seemed that at the moment that the enormous narwhal had come to take breath at the surface of the water the air was engulfed in its lungs like the steam in the vast cylinders of a machine of two thousand horsepower  hum thought i a whale with the strength of a cavalry regiment would be a pretty whale  we were on the qui vive till daylight and prepared for the combat the fishing implements were laid along the hammock nettings the second lieutenant loaded the blunder busses which could throw harpoons to the distance of a mile and long duckguns with explosive bullets which inflicted mortal wounds even to the most terrible animals ned land contented himself with sharpening his harpoona terrible weapon in his hands  at six oclock day began to break and with the first glimmer of light the electric light of the narwhal disappeared at seven oclock the day was sufficiently advanced but a very thick sea fog obscured our view and the best spy glasses could not pierce it that caused disappointment and anger  i climbed the mizzenmast some officers were already perched on the mastheads at eight oclock the fog lay heavily on the waves and its thick scrolls rose little by little the horizon grew wider and clearer at the same time suddenly just as on the day before ned lands voice was heard  the thing itself on the port quarter cried the harpooner  every eye was turned towards the point indicated  there a mile and a half from the frigate a long blackish body emerged a yard above the waves its tail violently agitated produced a considerable eddy never did a tail beat the sea with such violence  an immense track of dazzling whiteness marked the passage of the animal and described a long curve  the frigate approached the cetacean  i examined it thoroughly  the reports of the shannon and of the helvetia had rather exaggerated its size and i estimated its length at only two hundred and fifty feet  as to its dimensions i could only conjecture them to be admirably proportioned while i watched this phenomenon two jets of steam and water were ejected from its vents and rose to the height of 0 feet thus i ascertained its way of breathing  i concluded definitely that it belonged to the vertebrate branch class mammalia  the crew waited impatiently for their chiefs orders  the latter after having observed the animal attentively called the engineer the engineer ran to him  sir said the commander you have steam up  yes sir answered the engineer  well make up your fires and put on all steam  three hurrahs greeted this order  the time for the struggle had arrived some moments after the two funnels of the frigate vomited torrents of black smoke and the bridge quaked under the trembling of the boilers  the abraham lincoln propelled by her wonderful screw went straight at the animal  the latter allowed it to come within half a cables length then as if disdaining to dive it took a little turn and stopped a short distance off  this pursuit lasted nearly threequarters of an hour without the frigate gaining two yards on the cetacean it was quite evident that at that rate we should never come up with it  well mr land asked the captain do you advise me to put the boats out to sea  no sir replied ned land because we shall not take that beast easily  what shall we do then  put on more steam if you can sir  with your leave i mean to post myself under the bowsprit and if we get within harpooning distance i shall throw my harpoon  go ned said the captain  engineer put on more pressure  ned land went to his post  the fires were increased the screw revolved fortythree times a minute and the steam poured out of the valves we heaved the log and calculated that the abraham lincoln was going at the rate of   miles an hour  but the accursed animal swam at the same speed  for a whole hour the frigate kept up this pace without gaining six feet it was humiliating for one of the swiftest sailers in the american navy a stubborn anger seized the crew the sailors abused the monster who as before disdained to answer them the captain no longer contented himself with twisting his beardhe gnawed it  the engineer was called again  you have turned full steam on  yes sir replied the engineer  the speed of the abraham lincoln increased  its masts trembled down to their stepping holes and the clouds of smoke could hardly find way out of the narrow funnels  they heaved the log a second time  well asked the captain of the man at the wheel  nineteen miles and threetenths sir  clap on more steam  the engineer obeyed  the manometer showed ten degrees but the cetacean grew warm itself no doubt for without straining itself it made  0 miles  what a pursuit  no i cannot describe the emotion that vibrated through me ned land kept his post harpoon in hand  several times the animal let us gain upon itwe shall catch it we shall catch it cried the canadian but just as he was going to strike the cetacean stole away with a rapidity that could not be estimated at less than thirty miles an hour and even during our maximum of speed it bullied the frigate going round and round it a cry of fury broke from everyone  at noon we were no further advanced than at eight oclock in the morning  the captain then decided to take more direct means  ah said he that animal goes quicker than the abraham lincoln very well we will see whether it will escape these conical bullets send your men to the forecastle sir  the forecastle gun was immediately loaded and slewed round but the shot passed some feet above the cetacean which was half a mile off  another more to the right cried the commander and five dollars to whoever will hit that infernal beast  an old gunner with a grey beardthat i can see nowwith steady eye and grave face went up to the gun and took a long aim a loud report was heard with which were mingled the cheers of the crew  the bullet did its work it hit the animal and sliding off the rounded surface was lost in two miles depth of sea  the chase began again and the captain leaning towards me said  i will pursue that beast till my frigate bursts up  yes answered i and you will be quite right to do it  i wished the beast would exhaust itself and not be insensible to fatigue like a steam engine  but it was of no use hours passed without its showing any signs of exhaustion  however it must be said in praise of the abraham lincoln that she struggled on indefatigably  i cannot reckon the distance she made under three hundred miles during this unlucky day november the th but night came on and overshadowed the rough ocean  now i thought our expedition was at an end and that we should never again see the extraordinary animal  i was mistaken at ten minutes to eleven in the evening the electric light reappeared three miles to windward of the frigate as pure as intense as during the preceding night  the narwhal seemed motionless perhaps tired with its days work it slept letting itself float with the undulation of the waves now was a chance of which the captain resolved to take advantage  he gave his orders  the abraham lincoln kept up half steam and advanced cautiously so as not to awake its adversary it is no rare thing to meet in the middle of the ocean whales so sound asleep that they can be successfully attacked and ned land had harpooned more than one during its sleep the canadian went to take his place again under the bowsprit  the frigate approached noiselessly stopped at two cables lengths from the animal and following its track no one breathed a deep silence reigned on the bridge we were not a hundred feet from the burning focus the light of which increased and dazzled our eyes  at this moment leaning on the forecastle bulwark i saw below me ned land grappling the martingale in one hand brandishing his terrible harpoon in the other scarcely twenty feet from the motionless animal suddenly his arm straightened and the harpoon was thrown i heard the sonorous stroke of the weapon which seemed to have struck a hard body the electric light went out suddenly and two enormous waterspouts broke over the bridge of the frigate rushing like a torrent from stem to stern overthrowing men and breaking the lashings of the spars a fearful shock followed and thrown over the rail without having time to stop myself i fell into the sea    chapter vii  an unknown species of whale  this unexpected fall so stunned me that i have no clear recollection of my sensations at the time i was at first drawn down to a depth of about twenty feet i am a good swimmer though without pretending to rival byron or edgar poe who were masters of the art and in that plunge i did not lose my presence of mind two vigorous strokes brought me to the surface of the water my first care was to look for the frigate  had the crew seen me disappear  had the abraham lincoln veered round would the captain put out a boat  might i hope to be saved  the darkness was intense  i caught a glimpse of a black mass disappearing in the east its beacon lights dying out in the distance  it was the frigate i was lost  help help  i shouted swimming towards the abraham lincoln in desperation  my clothes encumbered me they seemed glued to my body and paralysed my movements  i was sinking  i was suffocating  help  this was my last cry  my mouth filled with water i struggled against being drawn down the abyss suddenly my clothes were seized by a strong hand and i felt myself quickly drawn up to the surface of the sea and i heard yes i heard these words pronounced in my ear  if master would be so good as to lean on my shoulder master would swim with much greater ease  i seized with one hand my faithful conseils arm  is it you said i you  myself answered conseil and waiting masters orders  that shock threw you as well as me into the sea  no but being in my masters service i followed him  the worthy fellow thought that was but natural  and the frigate  i asked  the frigate replied conseil turning on his back i think that master had better not count too much on her  you think so  i say that at the time i threw myself into the sea i heard the men at the wheel say `the screw and the rudder are broken  broken  yes broken by the monsters teeth  it is the only injury the abraham lincoln has sustained  but it is a bad lookout for us she no longer answers her helm  then we are lost  perhaps so calmly answered conseil  however we have still several hours before us and one can do a good deal in some hours  conseils imperturbable coolness set me up again i swam more vigorously but cramped by my clothes which stuck to me like a leaden weight i felt great difficulty in bearing up conseil saw this  will master let me make a slit said he and slipping an open knife under my clothes he ripped them up from top to bottom very rapidly then he cleverly slipped them off me while i swam for both of us  then i did the same for conseil and we continued to swim near to each other  nevertheless our situation was no less terrible perhaps our disappearance had not been noticed and if it had been the frigate could not tack being without its helm conseil argued on this supposition and laid his plans accordingly this quiet boy was perfectly selfpossessed we then decided that as our only chance of safety was being picked up by the abraham lincolns boats we ought to manage so as to wait for them as long as possible  i resolved then to husband our strength so that both should not be exhausted at the same time and this is how we managed  while one of us lay on our back quite still with arms crossed and legs stretched out the other would swim and push the other on in front this towing business did not last more than ten minutes each and relieving each other thus we could swim on for some hours perhaps till daybreak poor chance but hope is so firmly rooted in the heart of man  moreover there were two of us indeed i declare though it may seem improbable if i sought to destroy all hopeif i wished to despair i could not  the collision of the frigate with the cetacean had occurred about eleven oclock in the evening before i reckoned then we should have eight hours to swim before sunrise an operation quite practicable if we relieved each other the sea very calm was in our favour  sometimes i tried to pierce the intense darkness that was only dispelled by the phosphorescence caused by our movements i watched the luminous waves that broke over my hand whose mirrorlike surface was spotted with silvery rings one might have said that we were in a bath of quicksilver  near one oclock in the morning i was seized with dreadful fatigue my limbs stiffened under the strain of violent cramp  conseil was obliged to keep me up and our preservation devolved on him alone i heard the poor boy pant his breathing became short and hurried i found that he could not keep up much longer  leave me leave me  i said to him  leave my master  never replied he  i would drown first  just then the moon appeared through the fringes of a thick cloud that the wind was driving to the east the surface of the sea glittered with its rays this kindly light reanimated us  my head got better again i looked at all points of the horizon  i saw the frigate she was five miles from us and looked like a dark mass hardly discernible  but no boats  i would have cried out  but what good would it have been at such a distance my swollen lips could utter no sounds  conseil could articulate some words and i heard him repeat at intervals help help  our movements were suspended for an instant we listened it might be only a singing in the ear but it seemed to me as if a cry answered the cry from conseil  did you hear  i murmured  yes  yes  and conseil gave one more despairing cry  this time there was no mistake  a human voice responded to ours was it the voice of another unfortunate creature abandoned in the middle of the ocean some other victim of the shock sustained by the vessel or rather was it a boat from the frigate that was hailing us in the darkness  conseil made a last effort and leaning on my shoulder while i struck out in a desperate effort he raised himself half out of the water then fell back exhausted  what did you see  i saw murmured he i sawbut do not talkreserve all your strength  what had he seen  then i know not why the thought of the monster came into my head for the first time but that voice  the time is past for jonahs to take refuge in whales bellies  however conseil was towing me again he raised his head sometimes looked before us and uttered a cry of recognition which was responded to by a voice that came nearer and nearer  i scarcely heard it  my strength was exhausted my fingers stiffened my hand afforded me support no longer my mouth convulsively opening filled with salt water cold crept over me  i raised my head for the last time then i sank  at this moment a hard body struck me  i clung to it then i felt that i was being drawn up that i was brought to the surface of the water that my chest collapsedi fainted  it is certain that i soon came to thanks to the vigorous rubbings that i received  i half opened my eyes  conseil  i murmured  does master call me asked conseil  just then by the waning light of the moon which was sinking down to the horizon i saw a face which was not conseils and which i immediately recognised  ned  i cried  the same sir who is seeking his prize replied the canadian  were you thrown into the sea by the shock to the frigate  yes professor but more fortunate than you i was able to find a footing almost directly upon a floating island  an island  or more correctly speaking on our gigantic narwhal  explain yourself ned  only i soon found out why my harpoon had not entered its skin and was blunted  why ned why  because professor that beast is made of sheet iron  the canadians last words produced a sudden revolution in my brain i wriggled myself quickly to the top of the being or object half out of the water which served us for a refuge  i kicked it it was evidently a hard impenetrable body and not the soft substance that forms the bodies of the great marine mammalia  but this hard body might be a bony covering like that of the antediluvian animals and i should be free to class this monster among amphibious reptiles such as tortoises or alligators  well no the blackish back that supported me was smooth polished without scales  the blow produced a metallic sound and incredible though it may be it seemed i might say as if it was made of riveted plates  there was no doubt about it  this monster this natural phenomenon that had puzzled the learned world and over thrown and misled the imagination of seamen of both hemispheres it must be owned was a still more astonishing phenomenon inasmuch as it was a simply human construction  we had no time to lose however  we were lying upon the back of a sort of submarine boat which appeared as far as i could judge like a huge fish of steel  ned lands mind was made up on this point conseil and i could only agree with him  just then a bubbling began at the back of this strange thing which was evidently propelled by a screw and it began to move we had only just time to seize hold of the upper part which rose about seven feet out of the water and happily its speed was not great  as long as it sails horizontally muttered ned land i do not mind but if it takes a fancy to dive i would not give two straws for my life  the canadian might have said still less  it became really necessary to communicate with the beings whatever they were shut up inside the machine i searched all over the outside for an aperture a panel or a manhole to use a technical expression but the lines of the iron rivets solidly driven into the joints of the iron plates were clear and uniform besides the moon disappeared then and left us in total darkness  at last this long night passed  my indistinct remembrance prevents my describing all the impressions it made i can only recall one circumstance  during some lulls of the wind and sea i fancied i heard several times vague sounds a sort of fugitive harmony produced by words of command what was then the mystery of this submarine craft of which the whole world vainly sought an explanation what kind of beings existed in this strange boat what mechanical agent caused its prodigious speed  daybreak appeared  the morning mists surrounded us but they soon cleared off  i was about to examine the hull which formed on deck a kind of horizontal platform when i felt it gradually sinking  oh confound it cried ned land kicking the resounding plate open you inhospitable rascals  happily the sinking movement ceased  suddenly a noise like iron works violently pushed aside came from the interior of the boat one iron plate was moved a man appeared uttered an odd cry and disappeared immediately  some moments after eight strong men with masked faces appeared noiselessly and drew us down into their formidable machine    chapter viii  mobilis in mobili  this forcible abduction so roughly carried out was accomplished with the rapidity of lightning  i shivered all over  whom had we to deal with no doubt some new sort of pirates who explored the sea in their own way hardly had the narrow panel closed upon me when i was enveloped in darkness my eyes dazzled with the outer light could distinguish nothing i felt my naked feet cling to the rungs of an iron ladder  ned land and conseil firmly seized followed me  at the bottom of the ladder a door opened and shut after us immediately with a bang  we were alone  where i could not say hardly imagine all was black and such a dense black that after some minutes my eyes had not been able to discern even the faintest glimmer  meanwhile ned land furious at these proceedings gave free vent to his indignation  confound it cried he here are people who come up to the scotch for hospitality  they only just miss being cannibals i should not be surprised at it but i declare that they shall not eat me without my protesting  calm yourself friend ned calm yourself replied conseil quietly do not cry out before you are hurt  we are not quite done for yet  not quite sharply replied the canadian but pretty near at all events  things look black  happily my bowie knife i have still and i can always see well enough to use it the first of these pirates who lays a hand on me  do not excite yourself ned i said to the harpooner and do not compromise us by useless violence  who knows that they will not listen to us let us rather try to find out where we are  i groped about  in five steps i came to an iron wall made of plates bolted together  then turning back i struck against a wooden table near which were ranged several stools the boards of this prison were concealed under a thick mat which deadened the noise of the feet  the bare walls revealed no trace of window or door  conseil going round the reverse way met me and we went back to the middle of the cabin which measured about twenty feet by ten as to its height ned land in spite of his own great height could not measure it  half an hour had already passed without our situation being bettered when the dense darkness suddenly gave way to extreme light our prison was suddenly lighted that is to say it became filled with a luminous matter so strong that i could not bear it at first in its whiteness and intensity i recognised that electric light which played round the submarine boat like a magnificent phenomenon of phosphorescence after shutting my eyes involuntarily i opened them and saw that this luminous agent came from a half globe unpolished placed in the roof of the cabin  at last one can see cried ned land who knife in hand stood on the defensive  yes said i but we are still in the dark about ourselves  let master have patience said the imperturbable conseil  the sudden lighting of the cabin enabled me to examine it minutely it only contained a table and five stools  the invisible door might be hermetically sealed  no noise was heard all seemed dead in the interior of this boat  did it move did it float on the surface of the ocean or did it dive into its depths i could not guess  a noise of bolts was now heard the door opened and two men appeared  one was short very muscular broadshouldered with robust limbs strong head an abundance of black hair thick moustache a quick penetrating look and the vivacity which characterises the population of southern france  the second stranger merits a more detailed description  i made out his prevailing qualities directly  selfconfidencebecause his head was well set on his shoulders and his black eyes looked around with cold assurance calmnessfor his skin rather pale showed his coolness of blood energyevinced by the rapid contraction of his lofty brows and couragebecause his deep breathing denoted great power of lungs  whether this person was thirtyfive or fifty years of age i could not say  he was tall had a large forehead straight nose a clearly cut mouth beautiful teeth with fine taper hands indicative of a highly nervous temperament this man was certainly the most admirable specimen i had ever met one particular feature was his eyes rather far from each other and which could take in nearly a quarter of the horizon at once  this facultyi verified it latergave him a range of vision far superior to ned lands when this stranger fixed upon an object his eyebrows met his large eyelids closed around so as to contract the range of his vision and he looked as if he magnified the objects lessened by distance as if he pierced those sheets of water so opaque to our eyes and as if he read the very depths of the seas  the two strangers with caps made from the fur of the sea otter and shod with sea boots of seals skin were dressed in clothes of a particular texture which allowed free movement of the limbs the taller of the two evidently the chief on board examined us with great attention without saying a word then turning to his companion talked with him in an unknown tongue it was a sonorous harmonious and flexible dialect the vowels seeming to admit of very varied accentuation  the other replied by a shake of the head and added two or three perfectly incomprehensible words  then he seemed to question me by a look  i replied in good french that i did not know his language but he seemed not to understand me and my situation became more embarrassing  if master were to tell our story said conseil perhaps these gentlemen may understand some words  i began to tell our adventures articulating each syllable clearly and without omitting one single detail  i announced our names and rank introducing in person professor aronnax his servant conseil and master ned land the harpooner  the man with the soft calm eyes listened to me quietly even politely and with extreme attention but nothing in his countenance indicated that he had understood my story when i finished he said not a word  there remained one resource to speak english perhaps they would know this almost universal language i knew itas well as the german languagewell enough to read it fluently but not to speak it correctly  but anyhow we must make ourselves understood  go on in your turn i said to the harpooner speak your best anglosaxon and try to do better than i  ned did not beg off and recommenced our story  to his great disgust the harpooner did not seem to have made himself more intelligible than i had  our visitors did not stir they evidently understood neither the language of england nor of france  very much embarrassed after having vainly exhausted our speaking resources i knew not what part to take when conseil said  if master will permit me i will relate it in german  but in spite of the elegant terms and good accent of the narrator the german language had no success at last nonplussed i tried to remember my first lessons and to narrate our adventures in latin but with no better success this last attempt being of no avail the two strangers exchanged some words in their unknown language and retired  the door shut  it is an infamous shame cried ned land who broke out for the twentieth time  we speak to those rogues in french english german and latin and not one of them has the politeness to answer  calm yourself i said to the impetuous ned anger will do no good  but do you see professor replied our irascible companion that we shall absolutely die of hunger in this iron cage  bah said conseil philosophically we can hold out some time yet  my friends i said we must not despair  we have been worse off than this  do me the favour to wait a little before forming an opinion upon the commander and crew of this boat  my opinion is formed replied ned land sharply  they are rascals  good and from what country  from the land of rogues  my brave ned that country is not clearly indicated on the map of the world but i admit that the nationality of the two strangers is hard to determine neither english french nor german that is quite certain  however i am inclined to think that the commander and his companion were born in low latitudes  there is southern blood in them  but i cannot decide by their appearance whether they are spaniards turks arabians or indians as to their language it is quite incomprehensible  there is the disadvantage of not knowing all languages said conseil or the disadvantage of not having one universal language  as he said these words the door opened  a steward entered he brought us clothes coats and trousers made of a stuff i did not know i hastened to dress myself and my companions followed my example during that time the stewarddumb perhaps deafhad arranged the table and laid three plates  this is something like said conseil  bah said the angry harpooner what do you suppose they eat here tortoise liver filleted shark and beef steaks from seadogs  we shall see said conseil  the dishes of bell metal were placed on the table and we took our places  undoubtedly we had to do with civilised people and had it not been for the electric light which flooded us i could have fancied i was in the diningroom of the adelphi hotel at liverpool or at the grand hotel in paris i must say however that there was neither bread nor wine the water was fresh and clear but it was water and did not suit ned lands taste  amongst the dishes which were brought to us i recognised several fish delicately dressed but of some although excellent i could give no opinion neither could i tell to what kingdom they belonged whether animal or vegetable as to the dinnerservice it was elegant and in perfect taste each utensilspoon fork knife platehad a letter engraved on it with a motto above it of which this is an exact facsimile   mobilis in mobili n  the letter n was no doubt the initial of the name of the enigmatical person who commanded at the bottom of the seas  ned and conseil did not reflect much  they devoured the food and i did likewise  i was besides reassured as to our fate and it seemed evident that our hosts would not let us die of want  however everything has an end everything passes away even the hunger of people who have not eaten for fifteen hours our appetites satisfied we felt overcome with sleep  faith  i shall sleep well said conseil  so shall i replied ned land  my two companions stretched themselves on the cabin carpet and were soon sound asleep  for my own part too many thoughts crowded my brain too many insoluble questions pressed upon me too many fancies kept my eyes half open  where were we what strange power carried us on  i feltor rather fancied i felt the machine sinking down to the lowest beds of the sea dreadful nightmares beset me i saw in these mysterious asylums a world of unknown animals amongst which this submarine boat seemed to be of the same kind living moving and formidable as they then my brain grew calmer my imagination wandered into vague unconsciousness and i soon fell into a deep sleep    chapter ix  ned lands tempers  how long we slept i do not know but our sleep must have lasted long for it rested us completely from our fatigues  i woke first my companions had not moved and were still stretched in their corner  hardly roused from my somewhat hard couch i felt my brain freed my mind clear  i then began an attentive examination of our cell nothing was changed inside  the prison was still a prison the prisoners prisoners  however the steward during our sleep had cleared the table  i breathed with difficulty  the heavy air seemed to oppress my lungs  although the cell was large we had evidently consumed a great part of the oxygen that it contained indeed each man consumes in one hour the oxygen contained in more than  pints of air and this air charged as then with a nearly equal quantity of carbonic acid becomes unbreathable  it became necessary to renew the atmosphere of our prison and no doubt the whole in the submarine boat  that gave rise to a question in my mind how would the commander of this floating dwellingplace proceed would he obtain air by chemical means in getting by heat the oxygen contained in chlorate of potash and in absorbing carbonic acid by caustic potash ora more convenient economical and consequently more probable alternative would he be satisfied to rise and take breath at the surface of the water like a whale and so renew for twentyfour hours the atmospheric provision  in fact i was already obliged to increase my respirations to eke out of this cell the little oxygen it contained when suddenly i was refreshed by a current of pure air and perfumed with saline emanations it was an invigorating sea breeze charged with iodine  i opened my mouth wide and my lungs saturated themselves with fresh particles  at the same time i felt the boat rolling  the ironplated monster had evidently just risen to the surface of the ocean to breathe after the fashion of whales  i found out from that the mode of ventilating the boat  when i had inhaled this air freely i sought the conduit pipe which conveyed to us the beneficial whiff and i was not long in finding it above the door was a ventilator through which volumes of fresh air renewed the impoverished atmosphere of the cell  i was making my observations when ned and conseil awoke almost at the same time under the influence of this reviving air they rubbed their eyes stretched themselves and were on their feet in an instant  did master sleep well asked conseil with his usual politeness  very well my brave boy  and you mr land  soundly professor  but i dont know if i am right or not there seems to be a sea breeze  a seaman could not be mistaken and i told the canadian all that had passed during his sleep  good said he  that accounts for those roarings we heard when the supposed narwhal sighted the abraham lincoln  quite so master land it was taking breath  only mr aronnax i have no idea what oclock it is unless it is dinnertime  dinnertime my good fellow  say rather breakfasttime for we certainly have begun another day  so said conseil we have slept twentyfour hours  that is my opinion  i will not contradict you replied ned land  but dinner or breakfast the steward will be welcome whichever he brings  master land we must conform to the rules on board and i suppose our appetites are in advance of the dinner hour  that is just like you friend conseil said ned impatiently you are never out of temper always calm you would return thanks before grace and die of hunger rather than complain  time was getting on and we were fearfully hungry and this time the steward did not appear  it was rather too long to leave us if they really had good intentions towards us ned land tormented by the cravings of hunger got still more angry and notwithstanding his promise i dreaded an explosion when he found himself with one of the crew  for two hours more ned lands temper increased he cried he shouted but in vain  the walls were deaf  there was no sound to be heard in the boat all was still as death  it did not move for i should have felt the trembling motion of the hull under the influence of the screw plunged in the depths of the waters it belonged no longer to earth this silence was dreadful  i felt terrified conseil was calm ned land roared  just then a noise was heard outside  steps sounded on the metal flags the locks were turned the door opened and the steward appeared  before i could rush forward to stop him the canadian had thrown him down and held him by the throat  the steward was choking under the grip of his powerful hand  conseil was already trying to unclasp the harpooners hand from his halfsuffocated victim and i was going to fly to the rescue when suddenly i was nailed to the spot by hearing these words in french  be quiet master land and you professor will you be so good as to listen to me    chapter x  the man of the seas  it was the commander of the vessel who thus spoke  at these words ned land rose suddenly  the steward nearly strangled tottered out on a sign from his master but such was the power of the commander on board that not a gesture betrayed the resentment which this man must have felt towards the canadian  conseil interested in spite of himself i stupefied awaited in silence the result of this scene  the commander leaning against the corner of a table with his arms folded scanned us with profound attention  did he hesitate to speak did he regret the words which he had just spoken in french one might almost think so  after some moments of silence which not one of us dreamed of breaking gentlemen said he in a calm and penetrating voice i speak french english german and latin equally well i could therefore have answered you at our first interview but i wished to know you first then to reflect  the story told by each one entirely agreeing in the main points convinced me of your identity i know now that chance has brought before me m pierre aronnax professor of natural history at the museum of paris entrusted with a scientific mission abroad conseil his servant and ned land of canadian origin harpooner on board the frigate abraham lincoln of the navy of the united states of america  i bowed assent  it was not a question that the commander put to me therefore there was no answer to be made  this man expressed himself with perfect ease without any accent  his sentences were well turned his words clear and his fluency of speech remarkable  yet i did not recognise in him a fellowcountryman  he continued the conversation in these terms  you have doubtless thought sir that i have delayed long in paying you this second visit  the reason is that your identity recognised i wished to weigh maturely what part to act towards you i have hesitated much  most annoying circumstances have brought you into the presence of a man who has broken all the ties of humanity you have come to trouble my existence  unintentionally said i  unintentionally replied the stranger raising his voice a little was it unintentionally that the abraham lincoln pursued me all over the seas  was it unintentionally that you took passage in this frigate was it unintentionally that your cannonballs rebounded off the plating of my vessel  was it unintentionally that mr ned land struck me with his harpoon  i detected a restrained irritation in these words but to these recriminations i had a very natural answer to make and i made it  sir said i no doubt you are ignorant of the discussions which have taken place concerning you in america and europe you do not know that divers accidents caused by collisions with your submarine machine have excited public feeling in the two continents i omit the theories without number by which it was sought to explain that of which you alone possess the secret but you must understand that in pursuing you over the high seas of the pacific the abraham lincoln believed itself to be chasing some powerful seamonster of which it was necessary to rid the ocean at any price  a halfsmile curled the lips of the commander  then in a calmer tone  m aronnax he replied dare you affirm that your frigate would not as soon have pursued and cannonaded a submarine boat as a monster  this question embarrassed me for certainly captain farragut might not have hesitated  he might have thought it his duty to destroy a contrivance of this kind as he would a gigantic narwhal  you understand then sir continued the stranger that i have the right to treat you as enemies  i answered nothing purposely  for what good would it be to discuss such a proposition when force could destroy the best arguments  i have hesitated some time continued the commander nothing obliged me to show you hospitality  if i chose to separate myself from you i should have no interest in seeing you again i could place you upon the deck of this vessel which has served you as a refuge i could sink beneath the waters and forget that you had ever existed would not that be my right  it might be the right of a savage i answered but not that of a civilised man  professor replied the commander quickly i am not what you call a civilised man  i have done with society entirely for reasons which i alone have the right of appreciating i do not therefore obey its laws and i desire you never to allude to them before me again  this was said plainly  a flash of anger and disdain kindled in the eyes of the unknown and i had a glimpse of a terrible past in the life of this man not only had he put himself beyond the pale of human laws but he had made himself independent of them free in the strictest acceptation of the word quite beyond their reach  who then would dare to pursue him at the bottom of the sea when on its surface he defied all attempts made against him  what vessel could resist the shock of his submarine monitor what cuirass however thick could withstand the blows of his spur no man could demand from him an account of his actions god if he believed in onehis conscience if he had one were the sole judges to whom he was answerable  these reflections crossed my mind rapidly whilst the stranger personage was silent absorbed and as if wrapped up in himself i regarded him with fear mingled with interest as doubtless oediphus regarded the sphinx  after rather a long silence the commander resumed the conversation  i have hesitated said he but i have thought that my interest might be reconciled with that pity to which every human being has a right you will remain on board my vessel since fate has cast you there you will be free and in exchange for this liberty i shall only impose one single condition  your word of honour to submit to it will suffice  speak sir i answered  i suppose this condition is one which a man of honour may accept  yes sir it is this  it is possible that certain events unforeseen may oblige me to consign you to your cabins for some hours or some days as the case may be  as i desire never to use violence i expect from you more than all the others a passive obedience in thus acting i take all the responsibility  i acquit you entirely for i make it an impossibility for you to see what ought not to be seen do you accept this condition  then things took place on board which to say the least were singular and which ought not to be seen by people who were not placed beyond the pale of social laws amongst the surprises which the future was preparing for me this might not be the least  we accept i answered only i will ask your permission sir to address one question to youone only  speak sir  you said that we should be free on board  entirely  i ask you then what you mean by this liberty  just the liberty to go to come to see to observe even all that passes here save under rare circumstancesthe liberty in short which we enjoy ourselves my companions and i  it was evident that we did not understand one another  pardon me sir i resumed but this liberty is only what every prisoner has of pacing his prison  it cannot suffice us  it must suffice you however  what we must renounce for ever seeing our country our friends our relations again  yes sir  but to renounce that unendurable worldly yoke which men believe to be liberty is not perhaps so painful as you think  well exclaimed ned land never will i give my word of honour not to try to escape  i did not ask you for your word of honour master land answered the commander coldly  sir i replied beginning to get angry in spite of my self you abuse your situation towards us it is cruelty  no sir it is clemency  you are my prisoners of war  i keep you when i could by a word plunge you into the depths of the ocean you attacked me  you came to surprise a secret which no man in the world must penetratethe secret of my whole existence and you think that i am going to send you back to that world which must know me no more  never  in retaining you it is not you whom i guard it is myself  these words indicated a resolution taken on the part of the commander against which no arguments would prevail  so sir i rejoined you give us simply the choice between life and death  simply  my friends said i to a question thus put there is nothing to answer but no word of honour binds us to the master of this vessel  none sir answered the unknown  then in a gentler tone he continued  now permit me to finish what i have to say to you  i know you m aronnax  you and your companions will not perhaps have so much to complain of in the chance which has bound you to my fate you will find amongst the books which are my favourite study the work which you have published on `the depths of the sea  i have often read it you have carried out your work as far as terrestrial science permitted you but you do not know allyou have not seen all  let me tell you then professor that you will not regret the time passed on board my vessel you are going to visit the land of marvels  these words of the commander had a great effect upon me  i cannot deny it my weak point was touched and i forgot for a moment that the contemplation of these sublime subjects was not worth the loss of liberty besides i trusted to the future to decide this grave question so i contented myself with saying  by what name ought i to address you  sir replied the commander i am nothing to you but captain nemo and you and your companions are nothing to me but the passengers of the nautilus  captain nemo called  a steward appeared  the captain gave him his orders in that strange language which i did not understand then turning towards the canadian and conseil  a repast awaits you in your cabin said he  be so good as to follow this man  and now m aronnax our breakfast is ready  permit me to lead the way  i am at your service captain  i followed captain nemo and as soon as i had passed through the door i found myself in a kind of passage lighted by electricity similar to the waist of a ship  after we had proceeded a dozen yards a second door opened before me  i then entered a diningroom decorated and furnished in severe taste  high oaken sideboards inlaid with ebony stood at the two extremities of the room and upon their shelves glittered china porcelain and glass of inestimable value the plate on the table sparkled in the rays which the luminous ceiling shed around while the light was tempered and softened by exquisite paintings  in the centre of the room was a table richly laid out captain nemo indicated the place i was to occupy  the breakfast consisted of a certain number of dishes the contents of which were furnished by the sea alone and i was ignorant of the nature and mode of preparation of some of them  i acknowledged that they were good but they had a peculiar flavour which i easily became accustomed to these different aliments appeared to me to be rich in phosphorus and i thought they must have a marine origin  captain nemo looked at me  i asked him no questions but he guessed my thoughts and answered of his own accord the questions which i was burning to address to him  the greater part of these dishes are unknown to you he said to me  however you may partake of them without fear they are wholesome and nourishing  for a long time i have renounced the food of the earth and i am never ill now my crew who are healthy are fed on the same food  so said i all these eatables are the produce of the sea  yes professor the sea supplies all my wants  sometimes i cast my nets in tow and i draw them in ready to break  sometimes i hunt in the midst of this element which appears to be inaccessible to man and quarry the game which dwells in my submarine forests my flocks like those of neptunes old shepherds graze fearlessly in the immense prairies of the ocean  i have a vast property there which i cultivate myself and which is always sown by the hand of the creator of all things  i can understand perfectly sir that your nets furnish excellent fish for your table i can understand also that you hunt aquatic game in your submarine forests but i cannot understand at all how a particle of meat no matter how small can figure in your bill of fare  this which you believe to be meat professor is nothing else than fillet of turtle  here are also some dolphins livers which you take to be ragout of pork  my cook is a clever fellow who excels in dressing these various products of the ocean taste all these dishes  here is a preserve of seacucumber which a malay would declare to be unrivalled in the world here is a cream of which the milk has been furnished by the cetacea and the sugar by the great fucus of the north sea and lastly permit me to offer you some preserve of anemones which is equal to that of the most delicious fruits  i tasted more from curiosity than as a connoisseur whilst captain nemo enchanted me with his extraordinary stories  you like the sea captain  yes i love it  the sea is everything  it covers seven tenths of the terrestrial globe  its breath is pure and healthy it is an immense desert where man is never lonely for he feels life stirring on all sides  the sea is only the embodiment of a supernatural and wonderful existence it is nothing but love and emotion it is the `living infinite as one of your poets has said  in fact professor nature manifests herself in it by her three kingdomsmineral vegetable and animal the sea is the vast reservoir of nature  the globe began with sea so to speak and who knows if it will not end with it in it is supreme tranquillity  the sea does not belong to despots upon its surface men can still exercise unjust laws fight tear one another to pieces and be carried away with terrestrial horrors but at thirty feet below its level their reign ceases their influence is quenched and their power disappears ah sir livelive in the bosom of the waters there only is independence  there i recognise no masters there i am free  captain nemo suddenly became silent in the midst of this enthusiasm by which he was quite carried away for a few moments he paced up and down much agitated then he became more calm regained his accustomed coldness of expression and turning towards me  now professor said he if you wish to go over the nautilus i am at your service  captain nemo rose  i followed him  a double door contrived at the back of the diningroom opened and i entered a room equal in dimensions to that which i had just quitted  it was a library  high pieces of furniture of black violet ebony inlaid with brass supported upon their wide shelves a great number of books uniformly bound  they followed the shape of the room terminating at the lower part in huge divans covered with brown leather which were curved to afford the greatest comfort  light movable desks made to slide in and out at will allowed one to rest ones book while reading in the centre stood an immense table covered with pamphlets amongst which were some newspapers already of old date the electric light flooded everything it was shed from four unpolished globes half sunk in the volutes of the ceiling i looked with real admiration at this room so ingeniously fitted up and i could scarcely believe my eyes  captain nemo said i to my host who had just thrown himself on one of the divans this is a library which would do honour to more than one of the continental palaces and i am absolutely astounded when i consider that it can follow you to the bottom of the seas  where could one find greater solitude or silence professor replied captain nemo  did your study in the museum afford you such perfect quiet  no sir and i must confess that it is a very poor one after yours you must have six or seven thousand volumes here  twelve thousand m aronnax  these are the only ties which bind me to the earth  but i had done with the world on the day when my nautilus plunged for the first time beneath the waters that day i bought my last volumes my last pamphlets my last papers and from that time i wish to think that men no longer think or write these books professor are at your service besides and you can make use of them freely  i thanked captain nemo and went up to the shelves of the library works on science morals and literature abounded in every language but i did not see one single work on political economy that subject appeared to be strictly proscribed  strange to say all these books were irregularly arranged in whatever language they were written and this medley proved that the captain of the nautilus must have read indiscriminately the books which he took up by chance  sir said i to the captain i thank you for having placed this library at my disposal  it contains treasures of science and i shall profit by them  this room is not only a library said captain nemo it is also a smokingroom  a smokingroom i cried  then one may smoke on board  certainly  then sir i am forced to believe that you have kept up a communication with havannah  not any answered the captain  accept this cigar m aronnax and though it does not come from havannah you will be pleased with it if you are a connoisseur  i took the cigar which was offered me its shape recalled the london ones but it seemed to be made of leaves of gold i lighted it at a little brazier which was supported upon an elegant bronze stem and drew the first whiffs with the delight of a lover of smoking who has not smoked for two days  it is excellent but it is not tobacco  no answered the captain this tobacco comes neither from havannah nor from the east  it is a kind of seaweed rich in nicotine with which the sea provides me but somewhat sparingly  at that moment captain nemo opened a door which stood opposite to that by which i had entered the library and i passed into an immense drawingroom splendidly lighted  it was a vast foursided room thirty feet long eighteen wide and fifteen high  a luminous ceiling decorated with light arabesques shed a soft clear light over all the marvels accumulated in this museum for it was in fact a museum in which an intelligent and prodigal hand had gathered all the treasures of nature and art with the artistic confusion which distinguishes a painters studio  several sentences are missing here in the omnibus edition  thirty firstrate pictures uniformly framed separated by bright drapery ornamented the walls which were hung with tapestry of severe design i saw works of great value the greater part of which i had admired in the special collections of europe and in the exhibitions of paintings  some admirable statues in marble and bronze after the finest antique models stood upon pedestals in the corners of this magnificent museum amazement as the captain of the nautilus had predicted had already begun to take possession of me  professor said this strange man you must excuse the unceremonious way in which i receive you and the disorder of this room  sir i answered without seeking to know who you are i recognise in you an artist  an amateur nothing more sir  formerly i loved to collect these beautiful works created by the hand of man i sought them greedily and ferreted them out indefatigably and i have been able to bring together some objects of great value these are my last souvenirs of that world which is dead to me in my eyes your modern artists are already old they have two or three thousand years of existence i confound them in my own mind masters have no age   paragraphs seem to be missing from this omnibus text here they have to do with musical composers a piano and a brief revery on the part of nemo  under elegant glass cases fixed by copper rivets were classed and labelled the most precious productions of the sea which had ever been presented to the eye of a naturalist my delight as a professor may be conceived   long paragraphs seem to be missing from this omnibus here  apart in separate compartments were spread out chaplets of pearls of the greatest beauty which reflected the electric light in little sparks of fire pink pearls torn from the pinnamarina of the red sea green pearls yellow blue and black pearls the curious productions of the divers molluscs of every ocean and certain mussels of the water courses of the north lastly several specimens of inestimable value some of these pearls were larger than a pigeons egg and were worth millions  this para has been altered the last sentence reworded  therefore to estimate the value of this collection was simply impossible captain nemo must have expended millions in the acquirement of these various specimens and i was thinking what source he could have drawn from to have been able thus to gratify his fancy for collecting when i was interrupted by these words  you are examining my shells professor  unquestionably they must be interesting to a naturalist but for me they have a far greater charm for i have collected them all with my own hand and there is not a sea on the face of the globe which has escaped my researches  i can understand captain the delight of wandering about in the midst of such riches  you are one of those who have collected their treasures themselves  no museum in europe possesses such a collection of the produce of the ocean  but if i exhaust all my admiration upon it i shall have none left for the vessel which carries it i do not wish to pry into your secrets  but i must confess that this nautilus with the motive power which is confined in it the contrivances which enable it to be worked the powerful agent which propels it all excite my curiosity to the highest pitch i see suspended on the walls of this room instruments of whose use i am ignorant  you will find these same instruments in my own room professor where i shall have much pleasure in explaining their use to you but first come and inspect the cabin which is set apart for your own use you must see how you will be accommodated on board the nautilus  i followed captain nemo who by one of the doors opening from each panel of the drawingroom regained the waist he conducted me towards the bow and there i found not a cabin but an elegant room with a bed dressingtable and several other pieces of excellent furniture  i could only thank my host  your room adjoins mine said he opening a door and mine opens into the drawingroom that we have just quitted  i entered the captains room  it had a severe almost a monkish aspect a small iron bedstead a table some articles for the toilet the whole lighted by a skylight  no comforts the strictest necessaries only  captain nemo pointed to a seat  be so good as to sit down he said  i seated myself and he began thus    chapter xi  all by electricity  sir said captain nemo showing me the instruments hanging on the walls of his room here are the contrivances required for the navigation of the nautilus  here as in the drawingroom i have them always under my eyes and they indicate my position and exact direction in the middle of the ocean some are known to you such as the thermometer which gives the internal temperature of the nautilus the barometer which indicates the weight of the air and foretells the changes of the weather the hygrometer which marks the dryness of the atmosphere the stormglass the contents of which by decomposing announce the approach of tempests the compass which guides my course the sextant which shows the latitude by the altitude of the sun chronometers by which i calculate the longitude and glasses for day and night which i use to examine the points of the horizon when the nautilus rises to the surface of the waves  these are the usual nautical instruments i replied and i know the use of them  but these others no doubt answer to the particular requirements of the nautilus this dial with movable needle is a manometer is it not  it is actually a manometer  but by communication with the water whose external pressure it indicates it gives our depth at the same time  and these other instruments the use of which i cannot guess  here professor i ought to give you some explanations will you be kind enough to listen to me  he was silent for a few moments then he said  there is a powerful agent obedient rapid easy which conforms to every use and reigns supreme on board my vessel  everything is done by means of it  it lights warms it and is the soul of my mechanical apparatus this agent is electricity  electricity  i cried in surprise  yes sir  nevertheless captain you possess an extreme rapidity of movement which does not agree well with the power of electricity until now its dynamic force has remained under restraint and has only been able to produce a small amount of power  professor said captain nemo my electricity is not everybodys you know what seawater is composed of  in a thousand grammes are found   per cent  of water and about   per cent of chloride of sodium then in a smaller quantity chlorides of magnesium and of potassium bromide of magnesium sulphate of magnesia sulphate and carbonate of lime  you see then that chloride of sodium forms a large part of it  so it is this sodium that i extract from the seawater and of which i compose my ingredients i owe all to the ocean it produces electricity and electricity gives heat light motion and in a word life to the nautilus  but not the air you breathe  oh  i could manufacture the air necessary for my consumption but it is useless because i go up to the surface of the water when i please however if electricity does not furnish me with air to breathe it works at least the powerful pumps that are stored in spacious reservoirs and which enable me to prolong at need and as long as i will my stay in the depths of the sea  it gives a uniform and unintermittent light which the sun does not  now look at this clock it is electrical and goes with a regularity that defies the best chronometers i have divided it into twentyfour hours like the italian clocks because for me there is neither night nor day sun nor moon but only that factitious light that i take with me to the bottom of the sea look just now it is ten oclock in the morning  exactly  another application of electricity  this dial hanging in front of us indicates the speed of the nautilus  an electric thread puts it in communication with the screw and the needle indicates the real speed look now we are spinning along with a uniform speed of fifteen miles an hour  it is marvelous  and i see captain you were right to make use of this agent that takes the place of wind water and steam  we have not finished m aronnax said captain nemo rising if you will allow me we will examine the stern of the nautilus  really i knew already the anterior part of this submarine boat of which this is the exact division starting from the ships head the diningroom five yards long separated from the library by a watertight partition the library five yards long the large drawingroom ten yards long separated from the captains room by a second watertight partition the said room five yards in length mine two and a half yards and lastly a reservoir of air seven and a half yards that extended to the bows total length thirty five yards or one hundred and five feet the partitions had doors that were shut hermetically by means of indiarubber instruments and they ensured the safety of the nautilus in case of a leak  i followed captain nemo through the waist and arrived at the centre of the boat  there was a sort of well that opened between two partitions an iron ladder fastened with an iron hook to the partition led to the upper end  i asked the captain what the ladder was used for  it leads to the small boat he said  what have you a boat  i exclaimed in surprise  of course an excellent vessel light and insubmersible that serves either as a fishing or as a pleasure boat  but then when you wish to embark you are obliged to come to the surface of the water  not at all  this boat is attached to the upper part of the hull of the nautilus and occupies a cavity made for it it is decked quite watertight and held together by solid bolts this ladder leads to a manhole made in the hull of the nautilus that corresponds with a similar hole made in the side of the boat by this double opening i get into the small vessel  they shut the one belonging to the nautilus i shut the other by means of screw pressure i undo the bolts and the little boat goes up to the surface of the sea with prodigious rapidity  i then open the panel of the bridge carefully shut till then i mast it hoist my sail take my oars and im off  but how do you get back on board  i do not come back m aronnax the nautilus comes to me  by your orders  by my orders  an electric thread connects us  i telegraph to it and that is enough  really i said astonished at these marvels nothing can be more simple  after having passed by the cage of the staircase that led to the platform i saw a cabin six feet long in which conseil and ned land enchanted with their repast were devouring it with avidity then a door opened into a kitchen nine feet long situated between the large storerooms there electricity better than gas itself did all the cooking  the streams under the furnaces gave out to the sponges of platina a heat which was regularly kept up and distributed they also heated a distilling apparatus which by evaporation furnished excellent drinkable water  near this kitchen was a bathroom comfortably furnished with hot and cold water taps  next to the kitchen was the berthroom of the vessel sixteen feet long but the door was shut and i could not see the management of it which might have given me an idea of the number of men employed on board the nautilus  at the bottom was a fourth partition that separated this office from the engineroom a door opened and i found myself in the compartment where captain nemocertainly an engineer of a very high orderhad arranged his locomotive machinery this engineroom clearly lighted did not measure less than sixtyfive feet in length  it was divided into two parts the first contained the materials for producing electricity and the second the machinery that connected it with the screw i examined it with great interest in order to understand the machinery of the nautilus  you see said the captain i use bunsens contrivances not ruhmkorffs those would not have been powerful enough bunsens are fewer in number but strong and large which experience proves to be the best  the electricity produced passes forward where it works by electromagnets of great size on a system of levers and cogwheels that transmit the movement to the axle of the screw this one the diameter of which is nineteen feet and the thread twentythree feet performs about 0 revolutions in a second  and you get then  a speed of fifty miles an hour  i have seen the nautilus manoeuvre before the abraham lincoln and i have my own ideas as to its speed  but this is not enough we must see where we go  we must be able to direct it to the right to the left above below  how do you get to the great depths where you find an increasing resistance which is rated by hundreds of atmospheres  how do you return to the surface of the ocean and how do you maintain yourselves in the requisite medium am i asking too much  not at all professor replied the captain with some hesitation since you may never leave this submarine boat  come into the saloon it is our usual study and there you will learn all you want to know about the nautilus    chapter xii  some figures  a moment after we were seated on a divan in the saloon smoking the captain showed me a sketch that gave the plan section and elevation of the nautilus  then he began his description in these words  here m aronnax are the several dimensions of the boat you are in  it is an elongated cylinder with conical ends it is very like a cigar in shape a shape already adopted in london in several constructions of the same sort the length of this cylinder from stem to stern is exactly  feet and its maximum breadth is twentysix feet it is not built quite like your longvoyage steamers but its lines are sufficiently long and its curves prolonged enough to allow the water to slide off easily and oppose no obstacle to its passage  these two dimensions enable you to obtain by a simple calculation the surface and cubic contents of the nautilus  its area measures 0 feet and its contents about 00 cubic yards that is to say when completely immersed it displaces 0000 feet of water or weighs 00 tons  when i made the plans for this submarine vessel i meant that ninetenths should be submerged  consequently it ought only to displace ninetenths of its bulk that is to say only to weigh that number of tons i ought not therefore to have exceeded that weight constructing it on the aforesaid dimensions  the nautilus is composed of two hulls one inside the other outside joined by tshaped irons which render it very strong  indeed owing to this cellular arrangement it resists like a block as if it were solid its sides cannot yield it coheres spontaneously and not by the closeness of its rivets and its perfect union of the materials enables it to defy the roughest seas  these two hulls are composed of steel plates whose density is from  to  that of water  the first is not less than two inches and a half thick and weighs  tons  the second envelope the keel twenty inches high and ten thick weighs only sixtytwo tons the engine the ballast the several accessories and apparatus appendages the partitions and bulkheads weigh  tons do you follow all this  i do  then when the nautilus is afloat under these circumstances onetenth is out of the water  now if i have made reservoirs of a size equal to this tenth or capable of holding 0 tons and if i fill them with water the boat weighing then 0 tons will be completely immersed  that would happen professor these reservoirs are in the lower part of the nautilus i turn on taps and they fill and the vessel sinks that had just been level with the surface  well captain but now we come to the real difficulty i can understand your rising to the surface but diving below the surface does not your submarine contrivance encounter a pressure and consequently undergo an upward thrust of one atmosphere for every thirty feet of water just about fifteen pounds per square inch  just so sir  then unless you quite fill the nautilus i do not see how you can draw it down to those depths  professor you must not confound statics with dynamics or you will be exposed to grave errors  there is very little labour spent in attaining the lower regions of the ocean for all bodies have a tendency to sink when i wanted to find out the necessary increase of weight required to sink the nautilus i had only to calculate the reduction of volume that seawater acquires according to the depth  that is evident  now if water is not absolutely incompressible it is at least capable of very slight compression  indeed after the most recent calculations this reduction is only 000 of an atmosphere for each thirty feet of depth if we want to sink 000 feet i should keep account of the reduction of bulk under a pressure equal to that of a column of water of a thousand feet the calculation is easily verified  now i have supplementary reservoirs capable of holding a hundred tons  therefore i can sink to a considerable depth  when i wish to rise to the level of the sea i only let off the water and empty all the reservoirs if i want the nautilus to emerge from the tenth part of her total capacity  i had nothing to object to these reasonings  i admit your calculations captain i replied i should be wrong to dispute them since daily experience confirms them but i foresee a real difficulty in the way  what sir  when you are about 000 feet deep the walls of the nautilus bear a pressure of 00 atmospheres  if then just now you were to empty the supplementary reservoirs to lighten the vessel and to go up to the surface the pumps must overcome the pressure of 00 atmospheres which is 00 lbs  per square inch from that a power  that electricity alone can give said the captain hastily i repeat sir that the dynamic power of my engines is almost infinite the pumps of the nautilus have an enormous power as you must have observed when their jets of water burst like a torrent upon the abraham lincoln besides i use subsidiary reservoirs only to attain a mean depth of 0 to 000 fathoms and that with a view of managing my machines also when i have a mind to visit the depths of the ocean five or six mlles below the surface i make use of slower but not less infallible means  what are they captain  that involves my telling you how the nautilus is worked  i am impatient to learn  to steer this boat to starboard or port to turn in a word following a horizontal plan i use an ordinary rudder fixed on the back of the sternpost and with one wheel and some tackle to steer by but i can also make the nautilus rise and sink and sink and rise by a vertical movement by means of two inclined planes fastened to its sides opposite the centre of flotation planes that move in every direction and that are worked by powerful levers from the interior if the planes are kept parallel with the boat it moves horizontally if slanted the nautilus according to this inclination and under the influence of the screw either sinks diagonally or rises diagonally as it suits me  and even if i wish to rise more quickly to the surface i ship the screw and the pressure of the water causes the nautilus to rise vertically like a balloon filled with hydrogen  bravo captain  but how can the steersman follow the route in the middle of the waters  the steersman is placed in a glazed box that is raised about the hull of the nautilus and furnished with lenses  are these lenses capable of resisting such pressure  perfectly  glass which breaks at a blow is nevertheless capable of offering considerable resistance  during some experiments of fishing by electric light in  in the northern seas we saw plates less than a third of an inch thick resist a pressure of sixteen atmospheres now the glass that i use is not less than thirty times thicker  granted  but after all in order to see the light must exceed the darkness and in the midst of the darkness in the water how can you see  behind the steersmans cage is placed a powerful electric reflector the rays from which light up the sea for half a mile in front  ah bravo bravo captain  now i can account for this phosphorescence in the supposed narwhal that puzzled us so i now ask you if the boarding of the nautilus and of the scotia that has made such a noise has been the result of a chance rencontre  quite accidental sir  i was sailing only one fathom below the surface of the water when the shock came it had no bad result  none sir  but now about your rencontre with the abraham lincoln  professor i am sorry for one of the best vessels in the american navy but they attacked me and i was bound to defend myself i contented myself however with putting the frigate hors de combat she will not have any difficulty in getting repaired at the next port  ah commander your nautilus is certainly a marvellous boat  yes professor and i love it as if it were part of myself if danger threatens one of your vessels on the ocean the first impression is the feeling of an abyss above and below on the nautilus mens hearts never fail them  no defects to be afraid of for the double shell is as firm as iron no rigging to attend to no sails for the wind to carry away no boilers to burst no fire to fear for the vessel is made of iron not of wood no coal to run short for electricity is the only mechanical agent no collision to fear for it alone swims in deep water no tempest to brave for when it dives below the water it reaches absolute tranquillity there sir that is the perfection of vessels  and if it is true that the engineer has more confidence in the vessel than the builder and the builder than the captain himself you understand the trust i repose in my nautilus for i am at once captain builder and engineer  but how could you construct this wonderful nautilus in secret  each separate portion m aronnax was brought from different parts of the globe  but these parts had to be put together and arranged  professor i had set up my workshops upon a desert island in the ocean there my workmen that is to say the brave men that i instructed and educated and myself have put together our nautilus  then when the work was finished fire destroyed all trace of our proceedings on this island that i could have jumped over if i had liked  then the cost of this vessel is great  m aronnax an iron vessel costs l per ton  now the nautilus weighed 00 it came therefore to l00 and l0000 more for fitting it up and about l00000 with the works of art and the collections it contains  one last question captain nemo  ask it professor  you are rich  immensely rich sir and i could without missing it pay the national debt of france  i stared at the singular person who spoke thus  was he playing upon my credulity  the future would decide that    chapter xiii  the black river  the portion of the terrestrial globe which is covered by water is estimated at upwards of eighty millions of acres this fluid mass comprises two billions two hundred and fifty millions of cubic miles forming a spherical body of a diameter of sixty leagues the weight of which would be three quintillions of tons  to comprehend the meaning of these figures it is necessary to observe that a quintillion is to a billion as a billion is to unity in other words there are as many billions in a quintillion as there are units in a billion this mass of fluid is equal to about the quantity of water which would be discharged by all the rivers of the earth in forty thousand years  during the geological epochs the ocean originally prevailed everywhere then by degrees in the silurian period the tops of the mountains began to appear the islands emerged then disappeared in partial deluges reappeared became settled formed continents till at length the earth became geographically arranged as we see in the present day the solid had wrested from the liquid thirtyseven million six hundred and fiftyseven square miles equal to twelve billions nine hundred and sixty millions of acres  the shape of continents allows us to divide the waters into five great portions  the arctic or frozen ocean the antarctic or frozen ocean the indian the atlantic and the pacific oceans  the pacific ocean extends from north to south between the two polar circles and from east to west between asia and america over an extent of  degrees of longitude  it is the quietest of seas its currents are broad and slow it has medium tides and abundant rain such was the ocean that my fate destined me first to travel over under these strange conditions  sir said captain nemo we will if you please take our bearings and fix the startingpoint of this voyage it is a quarter to twelve i will go up again to the surface  the captain pressed an electric clock three times the pumps began to drive the water from the tanks the needle of the manometer marked by a different pressure the ascent of the nautilus then it stopped  we have arrived said the captain  i went to the central staircase which opened on to the platform clambered up the iron steps and found myself on the upper part of the nautilus  the platform was only three feet out of water  the front and back of the nautilus was of that spindleshape which caused it justly to be compared to a cigar  i noticed that its iron plates slightly overlaying each other resembled the shell which clothes the bodies of our large terrestrial reptiles it explained to me how natural it was in spite of all glasses that this boat should have been taken for a marine animal  toward the middle of the platform the longboat half buried in the hull of the vessel formed a slight excrescence fore and aft rose two cages of medium height with inclined sides and partly closed by thick lenticular glasses one destined for the steersman who directed the nautilus the other containing a brilliant lantern to give light on the road  the sea was beautiful the sky pure  scarcely could the long vehicle feel the broad undulations of the ocean a light breeze from the east rippled the surface of the waters the horizon free from fog made observation easy nothing was in sight  not a quicksand not an island a vast desert  captain nemo by the help of his sextant took the altitude of the sun which ought also to give the latitude he waited for some moments till its disc touched the horizon whilst taking observations not a muscle moved the instrument could not have been more motionless in a hand of marble  twelve oclock sir said he  when you like  i cast a last look upon the sea slightly yellowed by the japanese coast and descended to the saloon  and now sir i leave you to your studies added the captain our course is ene our depth is twentysix fathoms here are maps on a large scale by which you may follow it the saloon is at your disposal and with your permission i will retire  captain nemo bowed and i remained alone lost in thoughts all bearing on the commander of the nautilus  for a whole hour was i deep in these reflections seeking to pierce this mystery so interesting to me then my eyes fell upon the vast planisphere spread upon the table and i placed my finger on the very spot where the given latitude and longitude crossed  the sea has its large rivers like the continents  they are special currents known by their temperature and their colour the most remarkable of these is known by the name of the gulf stream science has decided on the globe the direction of five principal currents one in the north atlantic a second in the south a third in the north pacific a fourth in the south and a fifth in the southern indian ocean it is even probable that a sixth current existed at one time or another in the northern indian ocean when the caspian and aral seas formed but one vast sheet of water  at this point indicated on the planisphere one of these currents was rolling the kuroscivo of the japanese the black river which leaving the gulf of bengal where it is warmed by the perpendicular rays of a tropical sun crosses the straits of malacca along the coast of asia turns into the north pacific to the aleutian islands carrying with it trunks of camphortrees and other indigenous productions and edging the waves of the ocean with the pure indigo of its warm water it was this current that the nautilus was to follow  i followed it with my eye saw it lose itself in the vastness of the pacific and felt myself drawn with it when ned land and conseil appeared at the door of the saloon  my two brave companions remained petrified at the sight of the wonders spread before them  where are we where are we exclaimed the canadian in the museum at quebec  my friends i answered making a sign for them to enter you are not in canada but on board the nautilus fifty yards below the level of the sea  but m aronnax said ned land can you tell me how many men there are on board  ten twenty fifty a hundred  i cannot answer you mr land it is better to abandon for a time all idea of seizing the nautilus or escaping from it this ship is a masterpiece of modern industry and i should be sorry not to have seen it  many people would accept the situation forced upon us if only to move amongst such wonders so be quiet and let us try and see what passes around us  see exclaimed the harpooner but we can see nothing in this iron prison we are walkingwe are sailingblindly  ned land had scarcely pronounced these words when all was suddenly darkness the luminous ceiling was gone and so rapidly that my eyes received a painful impression  we remained mute not stirring and not knowing what surprise awaited us whether agreeable or disagreeable  a sliding noise was heard one would have said that panels were working at the sides of the nautilus  it is the end of the end said ned land  suddenly light broke at each side of the saloon through two oblong openings the liquid mass appeared vividly lit up by the electric gleam  two crystal plates separated us from the sea  at first i trembled at the thought that this frail partition might break but strong bands of copper bound them giving an almost infinite power of resistance  the sea was distinctly visible for a mile all round the nautilus what a spectacle  what pen can describe it  who could paint the effects of the light through those transparent sheets of water and the softness of the successive gradations from the lower to the superior strata of the ocean  we know the transparency of the sea and that its clearness is far beyond that of rockwater the mineral and organic substances which it holds in suspension heightens its transparency in certain parts of the ocean at the antilles under seventyfive fathoms of water can be seen with surprising clearness a bed of sand  the penetrating power of the solar rays does not seem to cease for a depth of one hundred and fifty fathoms but in this middle fluid travelled over by the nautilus the electric brightness was produced even in the bosom of the waves it was no longer luminous water but liquid light  on each side a window opened into this unexplored abyss the obscurity of the saloon showed to advantage the brightness outside and we looked out as if this pure crystal had been the glass of an immense aquarium  you wished to see friend ned well you see now  curious curious muttered the canadian who forgetting his illtemper seemed to submit to some irresistible attraction and one would come further than this to admire such a sight  ah thought i to myself i understand the life of this man he has made a world apart for himself in which he treasures all his greatest wonders  for two whole hours an aquatic army escorted the nautilus during their games their bounds while rivalling each other in beauty brightness and velocity i distinguished the green labre the banded mullet marked by a double line of black the roundtailed goby of a white colour with violet spots on the back the japanese scombrus a beautiful mackerel of these seas with a blue body and silvery head the brilliant azurors whose name alone defies description some banded spares with variegated fins of blue and yellow the woodcocks of the seas some specimens of which attain a yard in length japanese salamanders spider lampreys serpents six feet long with eyes small and lively and a huge mouth bristling with teeth with many other species  our imagination was kept at its height interjections followed quickly on each other  ned named the fish and conseil classed them i was in ecstasies with the vivacity of their movements and the beauty of their forms  never had it been given to me to surprise these animals alive and at liberty in their natural element i will not mention all the varieties which passed before my dazzled eyes all the collection of the seas of china and japan  these fish more numerous than the birds of the air came attracted no doubt by the brilliant focus of the electric light  suddenly there was daylight in the saloon the iron panels closed again and the enchanting vision disappeared  but for a long time i dreamt on till my eyes fell on the instruments hanging on the partition the compass still showed the course to be ene the manometer indicated a pressure of five atmospheres equivalent to a depth of twenty five fathoms and the electric log gave a speed of fifteen miles an hour  i expected captain nemo but he did not appear the clock marked the hour of five  ned land and conseil returned to their cabin and i retired to my chamber my dinner was ready  it was composed of turtle soup made of the most delicate hawks bills of a surmullet served with puff paste the liver of which prepared by itself was most delicious and fillets of the emperorholocanthus the savour of which seemed to me superior even to salmon  i passed the evening reading writing and thinking then sleep overpowered me and i stretched myself on my couch of zostera and slept profoundly whilst the nautilus was gliding rapidly through the current of the black river    chapter xiv  a note of invitation  the next day was the th of november  i awoke after a long sleep of twelve hours  conseil came according to custom to know how i passed the night and to offer his services he had left his friend the canadian sleeping like a man who had never done anything else all his life  i let the worthy fellow chatter as he pleased without caring to answer him i was preoccupied by the absence of the captain during our sitting of the day before and hoping to see him today  as soon as i was dressed i went into the saloon  it was deserted i plunged into the study of the shell treasures hidden behind the glasses  the whole day passed without my being honoured by a visit from captain nemo the panels of the saloon did not open  perhaps they did not wish us to tire of these beautiful things  the course of the nautilus was ene her speed twelve knots the depth below the surface between twentyfive and thirty fathoms  the next day 0th of november the same desertion the same solitude  i did not see one of the ships crew ned and conseil spent the greater part of the day with me they were astonished at the puzzling absence of the captain was this singular man illhad he altered his intentions with regard to us  after all as conseil said we enjoyed perfect liberty we were delicately and abundantly fed  our host kept to his terms of the treaty we could not complain and indeed the singularity of our fate reserved such wonderful compensation for us that we had no right to accuse it as yet  that day i commenced the journal of these adventures which has enabled me to relate them with more scrupulous exactitude and minute detail  th november early in the morning  the fresh air spreading over the interior of the nautilus told me that we had come to the surface of the ocean to renew our supply of oxygen i directed my steps to the central staircase and mounted the platform  it was six oclock the weather was cloudy the sea grey but calm scarcely a billow  captain nemo whom i hoped to meet would he be there i saw no one but the steersman imprisoned in his glass cage seated upon the projection formed by the hull of the pinnace i inhaled the salt breeze with delight  by degrees the fog disappeared under the action of the suns rays the radiant orb rose from behind the eastern horizon the sea flamed under its glance like a train of gunpowder the clouds scattered in the heights were coloured with lively tints of beautiful shades and numerous mares tails which betokened wind for that day  but what was wind to this nautilus which tempests could not frighten  i was admiring this joyous rising of the sun so gay and so lifegiving when i heard steps approaching the platform i was prepared to salute captain nemo but it was his second whom i had already seen on the captains first visit who appeared he advanced on the platform not seeming to see me with his powerful glass to his eye he scanned every point of the horizon with great attention  this examination over he approached the panel and pronounced a sentence in exactly these terms  i have remembered it for every morning it was repeated under exactly the same conditions it was thus worded  nautron respoc lorni virch  what it meant i could not say  these words pronounced the second descended  i thought that the nautilus was about to return to its submarine navigation i regained the panel and returned to my chamber  five days sped thus without any change in our situation  every morning i mounted the platform  the same phrase was pronounced by the same individual but captain nemo did not appear  i had made up my mind that i should never see him again when on the th november on returning to my room with ned and conseil i found upon my table a note addressed to me i opened it impatiently  it was written in a bold clear hand the characters rather pointed recalling the german type the note was worded as follows   to professor aronnax on board the nautilus  th of november   captain nemo invites professor aronnax to a huntingparty which will take place tomorrow morning in the forests of the island of crespo he hopes that nothing will prevent the professor from being present and he will with pleasure see him joined by his companions  captain nemo commander of the nautilus   a hunt exclaimed ned  and in the forests of the island of crespo added conseil  oh then the gentleman is going on terra firma replied ned land  that seems to me to be clearly indicated said i reading the letter once more  well we must accept said the canadian  but once more on dry ground we shall know what to do  indeed i shall not be sorry to eat a piece of fresh venison  without seeking to reconcile what was contradictory between captain nemos manifest aversion to islands and continents and his invitation to hunt in a forest i contented myself with replying  let us first see where the island of crespo is  i consulted the planisphere and in  0 n lat and  0 w long i found a small island recognised in 0 by captain crespo and marked in the ancient spanish maps as rocca de la plata the meaning of which is the silver rock we were then about eighteen hundred miles from our startingpoint and the course of the nautilus a little changed was bringing it back towards the southeast  i showed this little rock lost in the midst of the north pacific to my companions  if captain nemo does sometimes go on dry ground said i he at least chooses desert islands  ned land shrugged his shoulders without speaking and conseil and he left me  after supper which was served by the steward mute and impassive i went to bed not without some anxiety  the next morning the th of november on awakening i felt that the nautilus was perfectly still  i dressed quickly and entered the saloon  captain nemo was there waiting for me  he rose bowed and asked me if it was convenient for me to accompany him as he made no allusion to his absence during the last eight days i did not mention it and simply answered that my companions and myself were ready to follow him  we entered the diningroom where breakfast was served  m aronnax said the captain pray share my breakfast without ceremony we will chat as we eat  for though i promised you a walk in the forest i did not undertake to find hotels there  so breakfast as a man who will most likely not have his dinner till very late  i did honour to the repast  it was composed of several kinds of fish and slices of seacucumber and different sorts of seaweed our drink consisted of pure water to which the captain added some drops of a fermented liquor extracted by the kamschatcha method from a seaweed known under the name of rhodomenia palmata captain nemo ate at first without saying a word  then he began  sir when i proposed to you to hunt in my submarine forest of crespo you evidently thought me mad  sir you should never judge lightly of any man  but captain believe me  be kind enough to listen and you will then see whether you have any cause to accuse me of folly and contradiction  i listen  you know as well as i do professor that man can live under water providing he carries with him a sufficient supply of breathable air in submarine works the workman clad in an impervious dress with his head in a metal helmet receives air from above by means of forcing pumps and regulators  that is a diving apparatus said i  just so but under these conditions the man is not at liberty he is attached to the pump which sends him air through an indiarubber tube and if we were obliged to be thus held to the nautilus we could not go far  and the means of getting free  i asked  it is to use the rouquayrol apparatus invented by two of your own countrymen which i have brought to perfection for my own use and which will allow you to risk yourself under these new physiological conditions without any organ whatever suffering it consists of a reservoir of thick iron plates in which i store the air under a pressure of fifty atmospheres  this reservoir is fixed on the back by means of braces like a soldiers knapsack its upper part forms a box in which the air is kept by means of a bellows and therefore cannot escape unless at its normal tension in the rouquayrol apparatus such as we use two india rubber pipes leave this box and join a sort of tent which holds the nose and mouth one is to introduce fresh air the other to let out the foul and the tongue closes one or the other according to the wants of the respirator but i in encountering great pressures at the bottom of the sea was obliged to shut my head like that of a diver in a ball of copper and it is to this ball of copper that the two pipes the inspirator and the expirator open  perfectly captain nemo but the air that you carry with you must soon be used when it only contains fifteen per cent of oxygen it is no longer fit to breathe  right  but i told you m aronnax that the pumps of the nautilus allow me to store the air under considerable pressure and on those conditions the reservoir of the apparatus can furnish breathable air for nine or ten hours  i have no further objections to make i answered i will only ask you one thing captainhow can you light your road at the bottom of the sea  with the ruhmkorff apparatus m aronnax one is carried on the back the other is fastened to the waist  it is composed of a bunsen pile which i do not work with bichromate of potash but with sodium a wire is introduced which collects the electricity produced and directs it towards a particularly made lantern  in this lantern is a spiral glass which contains a small quantity of carbonic gas  when the apparatus is at work this gas becomes luminous giving out a white and continuous light thus provided i can breathe and i can see  captain nemo to all my objections you make such crushing answers that i dare no longer doubt  but if i am forced to admit the rouquayrol and ruhmkorff apparatus i must be allowed some reservations with regard to the gun i am to carry  but it is not a gun for powder answered the captain  then it is an airgun  doubtless  how would you have me manufacture gun powder on board without either saltpetre sulphur or charcoal  besides i added to fire under water in a medium eight hundred and fiftyfive times denser than the air we must conquer very considerable resistance  that would be no difficulty  there exist guns according to fulton perfected in england by philip coles and burley in france by furcy and in italy by landi which are furnished with a peculiar system of closing which can fire under these conditions but i repeat having no powder i use air under great pressure which the pumps of the nautilus furnish abundantly  but this air must be rapidly used  well have i not my rouquayrol reservoir which can furnish it at need a tap is all that is required  besides m aronnax you must see yourself that during our submarine hunt we can spend but little air and but few balls  but it seems to me that in this twilight and in the midst of this fluid which is very dense compared with the atmosphere shots could not go far nor easily prove mortal  sir on the contrary with this gun every blow is mortal and however lightly the animal is touched it falls as if struck by a thunderbolt  why  because the balls sent by this gun are not ordinary balls but little cases of glass  these glass cases are covered with a case of steel and weighted with a pellet of lead they are real leyden bottles into which the electricity is forced to a very high tension with the slightest shock they are discharged and the animal however strong it may be falls dead  i must tell you that these cases are size number four and that the charge for an ordinary gun would be ten  i will argue no longer i replied rising from the table i have nothing left me but to take my gun  at all events i will go where you go  captain nemo then led me aft and in passing before neds and conseils cabin i called my two companions who followed promptly we then came to a cell near the machineryroom in which we put on our walkingdress    chapter xv  a walk on the bottom of the sea  this cell was to speak correctly the arsenal and wardrobe of the nautilus a dozen diving apparatuses hung from the partition waiting our use  ned land on seeing them showed evident repugnance to dress himself in one  but my worthy ned the forests of the island of crespo are nothing but submarine forests  good said the disappointed harpooner who saw his dreams of fresh meat fade away  and you m aronnax are you going to dress yourself in those clothes  there is no alternative master ned  as you please sir replied the harpooner shrugging his shoulders but as for me unless i am forced i will never get into one  no one will force you master ned said captain nemo  is conseil going to risk it asked ned  i follow my master wherever he goes replied conseil  at the captains call two of the ships crew came to help us dress in these heavy and impervious clothes made of indiarubber without seam and constructed expressly to resist considerable pressure one would have thought it a suit of armour both supple and resisting this suit formed trousers and waistcoat  the trousers were finished off with thick boots weighted with heavy leaden soles the texture of the waistcoat was held together by bands of copper which crossed the chest protecting it from the great pressure of the water and leaving the lungs free to act the sleeves ended in gloves which in no way restrained the movement of the hands there was a vast difference noticeable between these consummate apparatuses and the old cork breastplates jackets and other contrivances in vogue during the eighteenth century  captain nemo and one of his companions a sort of hercules who must have possessed great strength conseil and myself were soon enveloped in the dresses  there remained nothing more to be done but to enclose our heads in the metal box but before proceeding to this operation i asked the captains permission to examine the guns  one of the nautilus men gave me a simple gun the butt end of which made of steel hollow in the centre was rather large it served as a reservoir for compressed air which a valve worked by a spring allowed to escape into a metal tube a box of projectiles in a groove in the thickness of the butt end contained about twenty of these electric balls which by means of a spring were forced into the barrel of the gun as soon as one shot was fired another was ready  captain nemo said i this arm is perfect and easily handled i only ask to be allowed to try it  but how shall we gain the bottom of the sea  at this moment professor the nautilus is stranded in five fathoms and we have nothing to do but to start  but how shall we get off  you shall see  captain nemo thrust his head into the helmet conseil and i did the same not without hearing an ironical good sport from the canadian the upper part of our dress terminated in a copper collar upon which was screwed the metal helmet  three holes protected by thick glass allowed us to see in all directions by simply turning our head in the interior of the headdress as soon as it was in position the rouquayrol apparatus on our backs began to act and for my part i could breathe with ease  with the ruhmkorff lamp hanging from my belt and the gun in my hand i was ready to set out  but to speak the truth imprisoned in these heavy garments and glued to the deck by my leaden soles it was impossible for me to take a step  but this state of things was provided for  i felt myself being pushed into a little room contiguous to the wardrobe room my companions followed towed along in the same way  i heard a watertight door furnished with stopper plates close upon us and we were wrapped in profound darkness  after some minutes a loud hissing was heard  i felt the cold mount from my feet to my chest  evidently from some part of the vessel they had by means of a tap given entrance to the water which was invading us and with which the room was soon filled a second door cut in the side of the nautilus then opened we saw a faint light  in another instant our feet trod the bottom of the sea  and now how can i retrace the impression left upon me by that walk under the waters  words are impotent to relate such wonders captain nemo walked in front his companion followed some steps behind conseil and i remained near each other as if an exchange of words had been possible through our metallic cases  i no longer felt the weight of my clothing or of my shoes of my reservoir of air or my thick helmet in the midst of which my head rattled like an almond in its shell  the light which lit the soil thirty feet below the surface of the ocean astonished me by its power  the solar rays shone through the watery mass easily and dissipated all colour and i clearly distinguished objects at a distance of a hundred and fifty yards beyond that the tints darkened into fine gradations of ultramarine and faded into vague obscurity  truly this water which surrounded me was but another air denser than the terrestrial atmosphere but almost as transparent  above me was the calm surface of the sea we were walking on fine even sand not wrinkled as on a flat shore which retains the impression of the billows  this dazzling carpet really a reflector repelled the rays of the sun with wonderful intensity which accounted for the vibration which penetrated every atom of liquid shall i be believed when i say that at the depth of thirty feet i could see as if i was in broad daylight  for a quarter of an hour i trod on this sand sown with the impalpable dust of shells  the hull of the nautilus resembling a long shoal disappeared by degrees but its lantern when darkness should overtake us in the waters would help to guide us on board by its distinct rays  soon forms of objects outlined in the distance were discernible i recognised magnificent rocks hung with a tapestry of zoophytes of the most beautiful kind and i was at first struck by the peculiar effect of this medium  it was then ten in the morning the rays of the sun struck the surface of the waves at rather an oblique angle and at the touch of their light decomposed by refraction as through a prism flowers rocks plants shells and polypi were shaded at the edges by the seven solar colours it was marvellous a feast for the eyes this complication of coloured tints a perfect kaleidoscope of green yellow orange violet indigo and blue in one word the whole palette of an enthusiastic colourist why could i not communicate to conseil the lively sensations which were mounting to my brain and rival him in expressions of admiration for aught i knew captain nemo and his companion might be able to exchange thoughts by means of signs previously agreed upon  so for want of better i talked to myself i declaimed in the copper box which covered my head thereby expending more air in vain words than was perhaps wise  various kinds of isis clusters of pure tuftcoral prickly fungi and anemones formed a brilliant garden of flowers decked with their collarettes of blue tentacles seastars studding the sandy bottom it was a real grief to me to crush under my feet the brilliant specimens of molluscs which strewed the ground by thousands of hammerheads donaciae veritable bounding shells of staircases and red helmetshells angelwings and many others produced by this inexhaustible ocean  but we were bound to walk so we went on whilst above our heads waved medusae whose umbrellas of opal or rosepink escalloped with a band of blue sheltered us from the rays of the sun and fiery pelagiae which in the darkness would have strewn our path with phosphorescent light  all these wonders i saw in the space of a quarter of a mile scarcely stopping and following captain nemo who beckoned me on by signs  soon the nature of the soil changed to the sandy plain succeeded an extent of slimy mud which the americans call ooze composed of equal parts of silicious and calcareous shells  we then travelled over a plain of seaweed of wild and luxuriant vegetation this sward was of close texture and soft to the feet and rivalled the softest carpet woven by the hand of man but whilst verdure was spread at our feet it did not abandon our heads a light network of marine plants of that inexhaustible family of seaweeds of which more than two thousand kinds are known grew on the surface of the water  i noticed that the green plants kept nearer the top of the sea whilst the red were at a greater depth leaving to the black or brown the care of forming gardens and parterres in the remote beds of the ocean  we had quitted the nautilus about an hour and a half it was near noon i knew by the perpendicularity of the suns rays which were no longer refracted  the magical colours disappeared by degrees and the shades of emerald and sapphire were effaced we walked with a regular step which rang upon the ground with astonishing intensity the slightest noise was transmitted with a quickness to which the ear is unaccustomed on the earth indeed water is a better conductor of sound than air in the ratio of four to one at this period the earth sloped downwards the light took a uniform tint we were at a depth of a hundred and five yards and twenty inches undergoing a pressure of six atmospheres  at this depth i could still see the rays of the sun though feebly to their intense brilliancy had succeeded a reddish twilight the lowest state between day and night but we could still see well enough it was not necessary to resort to the ruhmkorff apparatus as yet at this moment captain nemo stopped he waited till i joined him and then pointed to an obscure mass looming in the shadow at a short distance  it is the forest of the island of crespo thought i and i was not mistaken    chapter xvi  a submarine forest  we had at last arrived on the borders of this forest doubtless one of the finest of captain nemos immense domains he looked upon it as his own and considered he had the same right over it that the first men had in the first days of the world and indeed who would have disputed with him the possession of this submarine property  what other hardier pioneer would come hatchet in hand to cut down the dark copses  this forest was composed of large treeplants and the moment we penetrated under its vast arcades i was struck by the singular position of their branchesa position i had not yet observed  not an herb which carpeted the ground not a branch which clothed the trees was either broken or bent nor did they extend horizontally all stretched up to the surface of the ocean  not a filament not a ribbon however thin they might be but kept as straight as a rod of iron the fuci and llianas grew in rigid perpendicular lines due to the density of the element which had produced them  motionless yet when bent to one side by the hand they directly resumed their former position truly it was the region of perpendicularity  i soon accustomed myself to this fantastic position as well as to the comparative darkness which surrounded us the soil of the forest seemed covered with sharp blocks difficult to avoid  the submarine flora struck me as being very perfect and richer even than it would have been in the arctic or tropical zones where these productions are not so plentiful but for some minutes i involuntarily confounded the genera taking animals for plants and who would not have been mistaken the fauna and the flora are too closely allied in this submarine world  these plants are selfpropagated and the principle of their existence is in the water which upholds and nourishes them the greater number instead of leaves shoot forth blades of capricious shapes comprised within a scale of colours pink carmine green olive fawn and brown  curious anomaly fantastic element said an ingenious naturalist in which the animal kingdom blossoms and the vegetable does not  in about an hour captain nemo gave the signal to halt i for my part was not sorry and we stretched ourselves under an arbour of alariae the long thin blades of which stood up like arrows  this short rest seemed delicious to me there was nothing wanting but the charm of conversation but impossible to speak impossible to answer i only put my great copper head to conseils i saw the worthy fellows eyes glistening with delight and to show his satisfaction he shook himself in his breastplate of air in the most comical way in the world  after four hours of this walking i was surprised not to find myself dreadfully hungry  how to account for this state of the stomach i could not tell  but instead i felt an insurmountable desire to sleep which happens to all divers and my eyes soon closed behind the thick glasses and i fell into a heavy slumber which the movement alone had prevented before captain nemo and his robust companion stretched in the clear crystal set us the example  how long i remained buried in this drowsiness i cannot judge but when i woke the sun seemed sinking towards the horizon captain nemo had already risen and i was beginning to stretch my limbs when an unexpected apparition brought me briskly to my feet  a few steps off a monstrous seaspider about thirtyeight inches high was watching me with squinting eyes ready to spring upon me though my divers dress was thick enough to defend me from the bite of this animal i could not help shuddering with horror conseil and the sailor of the nautilus awoke at this moment captain nemo pointed out the hideous crustacean which a blow from the butt end of the gun knocked over and i saw the horrible claws of the monster writhe in terrible convulsions this incident reminded me that other animals more to be feared might haunt these obscure depths against whose attacks my divingdress would not protect me  i had never thought of it before but i now resolved to be upon my guard  indeed i thought that this halt would mark the termination of our walk but i was mistaken for instead of returning to the nautilus captain nemo continued his bold excursion  the ground was still on the incline its declivity seemed to be getting greater and to be leading us to greater depths  it must have been about three oclock when we reached a narrow valley between high perpendicular walls situated about seventyfive fathoms deep thanks to the perfection of our apparatus we were fortyfive fathoms below the limit which nature seems to have imposed on man as to his submarine excursions  i say seventyfive fathoms though i had no instrument by which to judge the distance  but i knew that even in the clearest waters the solar rays could not penetrate further  and accordingly the darkness deepened  at ten paces not an object was visible i was groping my way when i suddenly saw a brilliant white light captain nemo had just put his electric apparatus into use his companion did the same and conseil and i followed their example by turning a screw i established a communication between the wire and the spiral glass and the sea lit by our four lanterns was illuminated for a circle of thirtysix yards  as we walked i thought the light of our ruhmkorff apparatus could not fail to draw some inhabitant from its dark couch but if they did approach us they at least kept at a respectful distance from the hunters  several times i saw captain nemo stop put his gun to his shoulder and after some moments drop it and walk on  at last after about four hours this marvellous excursion came to an end a wall of superb rocks in an imposing mass rose before us a heap of gigantic blocks an enormous steep granite shore forming dark grottos but which presented no practicable slope it was the prop of the island of crespo  it was the earth captain nemo stopped suddenly  a gesture of his brought us all to a halt and however desirous i might be to scale the wall i was obliged to stop  here ended captain nemos domains and he would not go beyond them  further on was a portion of the globe he might not trample upon  the return began  captain nemo had returned to the head of his little band directing their course without hesitation  i thought we were not following the same road to return to the nautilus  the new road was very steep and consequently very painful  we approached the surface of the sea rapidly but this return to the upper strata was not so sudden as to cause relief from the pressure too rapidly which might have produced serious disorder in our organisation and brought on internal lesions so fatal to divers very soon light reappeared and grew and the sun being low on the horizon the refraction edged the different objects with a spectral ring at ten yards and a half deep we walked amidst a shoal of little fishes of all kinds more numerous than the birds of the air and also more agile but no aquatic game worthy of a shot had as yet met our gaze when at that moment i saw the captain shoulder his gun quickly and follow a moving object into the shrubs  he fired i heard a slight hissing and a creature fell stunned at some distance from us  it was a magnificent seaotter an enhydrus the only exclusively marine quadruped this otter was five feet long and must have been very valuable its skin chestnutbrown above and silvery underneath would have made one of those beautiful furs so sought after in the russian and chinese markets the fineness and the lustre of its coat would certainly fetch l0 i admired this curious mammal with its rounded head ornamented with short ears its round eyes and white whiskers like those of a cat with webbed feet and nails and tufted tail  this precious animal hunted and tracked by fishermen has now become very rare and taken refuge chiefly in the northern parts of the pacific or probably its race would soon become extinct  captain nemos companion took the beast threw it over his shoulder and we continued our journey  for one hour a plain of sand lay stretched before us sometimes it rose to within two yards and some inches of the surface of the water  i then saw our image clearly reflected drawn inversely and above us appeared an identical group reflecting our movements and our actions in a word like us in every point except that they walked with their heads downward and their feet in the air  another effect i noticed which was the passage of thick clouds which formed and vanished rapidly but on reflection i understood that these seeming clouds were due to the varying thickness of the reeds at the bottom and i could even see the fleecy foam which their broken tops multiplied on the water and the shadows of large birds passing above our heads whose rapid flight i could discern on the surface of the sea  on this occasion i was witness to one of the finest gun shots which ever made the nerves of a hunter thrill a large bird of great breadth of wing clearly visible approached hovering over us  captain nemos companion shouldered his gun and fired when it was only a few yards above the waves the creature fell stunned and the force of its fall brought it within the reach of dexterous hunters grasp it was an albatross of the finest kind  our march had not been interrupted by this incident for two hours we followed these sandy plains then fields of algae very disagreeable to cross  candidly i could do no more when i saw a glimmer of light which for a half mile broke the darkness of the waters  it was the lantern of the nautilus before twenty minutes were over we should be on board and i should be able to breathe with ease for it seemed that my reservoir supplied air very deficient in oxygen but i did not reckon on an accidental meeting which delayed our arrival for some time  i had remained some steps behind when i presently saw captain nemo coming hurriedly towards me  with his strong hand he bent me to the ground his companion doing the same to conseil at first i knew not what to think of this sudden attack but i was soon reassured by seeing the captain lie down beside me and remain immovable  i was stretched on the ground just under the shelter of a bush of algae when raising my head i saw some enormous mass casting phosphorescent gleams pass blusteringly by  my blood froze in my veins as i recognised two formidable sharks which threatened us  it was a couple of tintoreas terrible creatures with enormous tails and a dull glassy stare the phosphorescent matter ejected from holes pierced around the muzzle monstrous brutes which would crush a whole man in their iron jaws i did not know whether conseil stopped to classify them for my part i noticed their silver bellies and their huge mouths bristling with teeth from a very unscientific point of view and more as a possible victim than as a naturalist  happily the voracious creatures do not see well  they passed without seeing us brushing us with their brownish fins and we escaped by a miracle from a danger certainly greater than meeting a tiger fullface in the forest half an hour after guided by the electric light we reached the nautilus the outside door had been left open and captain nemo closed it as soon as we had entered the first cell  he then pressed a knob i heard the pumps working in the midst of the vessel i felt the water sinking from around me and in a few moments the cell was entirely empty the inside door then opened and we entered the vestry  there our divingdress was taken off not without some trouble and fairly worn out from want of food and sleep i returned to my room in great wonder at this surprising excursion at the bottom of the sea    chapter xvii  four thousand leagues under the pacific  the next morning the th of november i had quite recovered from my fatigues of the day before and i went up on to the platform just as the second lieutenant was uttering his daily phrase  i was admiring the magnificent aspect of the ocean when captain nemo appeared  he did not seem to be aware of my presence and began a series of astronomical observations then when he had finished he went and leant on the cage of the watchlight and gazed abstractedly on the ocean in the meantime a number of the sailors of the nautilus all strong and healthy men had come up onto the platform they came to draw up the nets that had been laid all night these sailors were evidently of different nations although the european type was visible in all of them i recognised some unmistakable irishmen frenchmen some sclaves and a greek or a candiote  they were civil and only used that odd language among themselves the origin of which i could not guess neither could i question them  the nets were hauled in  they were a large kind of chaluts like those on the normandy coasts great pockets that the waves and a chain fixed in the smaller meshes kept open  these pockets drawn by iron poles swept through the water and gathered in everything in their way that day they brought up curious specimens from those productive coasts  i reckoned that the haul had brought in more than nine hundredweight of fish it was a fine haul but not to be wondered at  indeed the nets are let down for several hours and enclose in their meshes an infinite variety we had no lack of excellent food and the rapidity of the nautilus and the attraction of the electric light could always renew our supply these several productions of the sea were immediately lowered through the panel to the stewards room some to be eaten fresh and others pickled  the fishing ended the provision of air renewed i thought that the nautilus was about to continue its submarine excursion and was preparing to return to my room when without further preamble the captain turned to me saying  professor is not this ocean gifted with real life  it has its tempers and its gentle moods  yesterday it slept as we did and now it has woke after a quiet night  look he continued it wakes under the caresses of the sun  it is going to renew its diurnal existence it is an interesting study to watch the play of its organisation it has a pulse arteries spasms and i agree with the learned maury who discovered in it a circulation as real as the circulation of blood in animals  yes the ocean has indeed circulation and to promote it the creator has caused things to multiply in itcaloric salt and animalculae  when captain nemo spoke thus he seemed altogether changed and aroused an extraordinary emotion in me  also he added true existence is there and i can imagine the foundations of nautical towns clusters of submarine houses which like the nautilus would ascend every morning to breathe at the surface of the water free towns independent cities yet who knows whether some despot  captain nemo finished his sentence with a violent gesture then addressing me as if to chase away some sorrowful thought  m aronnax he asked  do you know the depth of the ocean  i only know captain what the principal soundings have taught us  could you tell me them so that i can suit them to my purpose  these are some i replied that i remember  if i am not mistaken a depth of 000 yards has been found in the north atlantic and 00 yards in the mediterranean  the most remarkable soundings have been made in the south atlantic near the thirtyfifth parallel and they gave 000 yards 000 yards and 000 yards to sum up all it is reckoned that if the bottom of the sea were levelled its mean depth would be about one and threequarter leagues  well professor replied the captain we shall show you better than that i hope  as to the mean depth of this part of the pacific i tell you it is only 000 yards  having said this captain nemo went towards the panel and disappeared down the ladder  i followed him and went into the large drawingroom the screw was immediately put in motion and the log gave twenty miles an hour  during the days and weeks that passed captain nemo was very sparing of his visits  i seldom saw him the lieutenant pricked the ships course regularly on the chart so i could always tell exactly the route of the nautilus  nearly every day for some time the panels of the drawingroom were opened and we were never tired of penetrating the mysteries of the submarine world  the general direction of the nautilus was southeast and it kept between 00 and 0 yards of depth  one day however i do not know why being drawn diagonally by means of the inclined planes it touched the bed of the sea the thermometer indicated a temperature of  cent a temperature that at this depth seemed common to all latitudes  at three oclock in the morning of the th of november the nautilus crossed the tropic of cancer at  long  on th instant it sighted the sandwich islands where cook died february   we had then gone 0 leagues from our startingpoint in the morning when i went on the platform i saw two miles to windward hawaii the largest of the seven islands that form the group i saw clearly the cultivated ranges and the several mountainchains that run parallel with the side and the volcanoes that overtop mounarea which rise 000 yards above the level of the sea besides other things the nets brought up were several flabellariae and graceful polypi that are peculiar to that part of the ocean the direction of the nautilus was still to the southeast it crossed the equator december  in  long and on the th of the same month after crossing rapidly and without anything in particular occurring we sighted the marquesas group  i saw three miles off martins peak in noukahiva the largest of the group that belongs to france i only saw the woody mountains against the horizon because captain nemo did not wish to bring the ship to the wind  there the nets brought up beautiful specimens of fish  some with azure fins and tails like gold the flesh of which is unrivalled some nearly destitute of scales but of exquisite flavour others with bony jaws and yellowtinged gills as good as bonitos all fish that would be of use to us after leaving these charming islands protected by the french flag from the th to the th of december the nautilus sailed over about 000 miles  during the daytime of the th of december i was busy reading in the large drawingroom ned land and conseil watched the luminous water through the halfopen panels  the nautilus was immovable while its reservoirs were filled it kept at a depth of 000 yards a region rarely visited in the ocean and in which large fish were seldom seen  i was then reading a charming book by jean mace the slaves of the stomach and i was learning some valuable lessons from it when conseil interrupted me  will master come here a moment he said in a curious voice  what is the matter conseil  i want master to look  i rose went and leaned on my elbows before the panes and watched  in a full electric light an enormous black mass quite immovable was suspended in the midst of the waters  i watched it attentively seeking to find out the nature of this gigantic cetacean but a sudden thought crossed my mind  a vessel i said half aloud  yes replied the canadian a disabled ship that has sunk perpendicularly  ned land was right we were close to a vessel of which the tattered shrouds still hung from their chains  the keel seemed to be in good order and it had been wrecked at most some few hours three stumps of masts broken off about two feet above the bridge showed that the vessel had had to sacrifice its masts  but lying on its side it had filled and it was heeling over to port this skeleton of what it had once been was a sad spectacle as it lay lost under the waves but sadder still was the sight of the bridge where some corpses bound with ropes were still lying i counted fivefour men one of whom was standing at the helm and a woman standing by the poop holding an infant in her arms she was quite young  i could distinguish her features which the water had not decomposed by the brilliant light from the nautilus in one despairing effort she had raised her infant above her head poor little thingwhose arms encircled its mothers neck the attitude of the four sailors was frightful distorted as they were by their convulsive movements whilst making a last effort to free themselves from the cords that bound them to the vessel the steersman alone calm with a grave clear face his grey hair glued to his forehead and his hand clutching the wheel of the helm seemed even then to be guiding the three broken masts through the depths of the ocean  what a scene  we were dumb our hearts beat fast before this shipwreck taken as it were from life and photographed in its last moments and i saw already coming towards it with hungry eyes enormous sharks attracted by the human flesh  however the nautilus turning went round the submerged vessel and in one instant i read on the sternthe florida sunderland    chapter xviii  vanikoro  this terrible spectacle was the forerunner of the series of maritime catastrophes that the nautilus was destined to meet with in its route as long as it went through more frequented waters we often saw the hulls of shipwrecked vessels that were rotting in the depths and deeper down cannons bullets anchors chains and a thousand other iron materials eaten up by rust  however on the th of december we sighted the pomotou islands the old dangerous group of bougainville that extend over a space of 00 leagues at ese to wnw from the island ducie to that of lazareff this group covers an area of 0 square leagues and it is formed of sixty groups of islands among which the gambier group is remarkable over which france exercises sway  these are coral islands slowly raised but continuous created by the daily work of polypi then this new island will be joined later on to the neighboring groups and a fifth continent will stretch from new zealand and new caledonia and from thence to the marquesas  one day when i was suggesting this theory to captain nemo he replied coldly  the earth does not want new continents but new men   paragraphs have been stripped from this edition  on th of december we left to the east the bewitching group of the societies and the graceful tahiti queen of the pacific i saw in the morning some miles to the windward the elevated summits of the island  these waters furnished our table with excellent fish mackerel bonitos and some varieties of a seaserpent  on the th of december the nautilus sailed into the midst of the new hebrides discovered by quiros in 0 and that bougainville explored in  and to which cook gave its present name in  this group is composed principally of nine large islands that form a band of 0 leagues nns to ssw between  and  s lat and  and  long  we passed tolerably near to the island of aurou that at noon looked like a mass of green woods surmounted by a peak of great height  that day being christmas day ned land seemed to regret sorely the noncelebration of christmas the family fete of which protestants are so fond  i had not seen captain nemo for a week when on the morning of the th he came into the large drawingroom always seeming as if he had seen you five minutes before i was busily tracing the route of the nautilus on the planisphere the captain came up to me put his finger on one spot on the chart and said this single word  vanikoro  the effect was magical  it was the name of the islands on which la perouse had been lost  i rose suddenly  the nautilus has brought us to vanikoro  i asked  yes professor said the captain  and i can visit the celebrated islands where the boussole and the astrolabe struck  if you like professor  when shall we be there  we are there now  followed by captain nemo i went up on to the platform and greedily scanned the horizon  to the ne two volcanic islands emerged of unequal size surrounded by a coral reef that measured forty miles in circumference we were close to vanikoro really the one to which dumont durville gave the name of isle de la recherche and exactly facing the little harbour of vanou situated in   s lat and   e long the earth seemed covered with verdure from the shore to the summits in the interior that were crowned by mount kapogo  feet high the nautilus having passed the outer belt of rocks by a narrow strait found itself among breakers where the sea was from thirty to forty fathoms deep  under the verdant shade of some mangroves i perceived some savages who appeared greatly surprised at our approach in the long black body moving between wind and water did they not see some formidable cetacean that they regarded with suspicion  just then captain nemo asked me what i knew about the wreck of la perouse  only what everyone knows captain i replied  and could you tell me what everyone knows about it he inquired ironically  easily  i related to him all that the last works of dumont durville had made known works from which the following is a brief account  la perouse and his second captain de langle were sent by louis xvi in  on a voyage of circumnavigation they embarked in the corvettes boussole and the astrolabe neither of which were again heard of  in  the french government justly uneasy as to the fate of these two sloops manned two large merchantmen the recherche and the esperance which left brest the th of september under the command of bruni dentrecasteaux  two months after they learned from bowen commander of the albemarle that the debris of shipwrecked vessels had been seen on the coasts of new georgia  but dentrecasteaux ignoring this communication rather uncertain besidesdirected his course towards the admiralty islands mentioned in a report of captain hunters as being the place where la perouse was wrecked  they sought in vain  the esperance and the recherche passed before vanikoro without stopping there and in fact this voyage was most disastrous as it cost dentrecasteaux his life and those of two of his lieutenants besides several of his crew  captain dillon a shrewd old pacific sailor was the first to find unmistakable traces of the wrecks  on the th of may  his vessel the st patrick passed close to tikopia one of the new hebrides there a lascar came alongside in a canoe sold him the handle of a sword in silver that bore the print of characters engraved on the hilt the lascar pretended that six years before during a stay at vanikoro he had seen two europeans that belonged to some vessels that had run aground on the reefs some years ago  dillon guessed that he meant la perouse whose disappearance had troubled the whole world  he tried to get on to vanikoro where according to the lascar he would find numerous debris of the wreck but winds and tides prevented him  dillon returned to calcutta  there he interested the asiatic society and the indian company in his discovery  a vessel to which was given the name of the recherche was put at his disposal and he set out rd january  accompanied by a french agent  the recherche after touching at several points in the pacific cast anchor before vanikoro th july  in that same harbour of vanou where the nautilus was at this time  there it collected numerous relics of the wreck iron utensils anchors pulleystrops swivelguns an  lb shot fragments of astronomical instruments a piece of crown work and a bronze clock bearing this inscriptionbazin ma fait the mark of the foundry of the arsenal at brest about  there could be no further doubt  dillon having made all inquiries stayed in the unlucky place till october then he quitted vanikoro and directed his course towards new zealand put into calcutta th april  and returned to france where he was warmly welcomed by charles x  but at the same time without knowing dillons movements dumont durville had already set out to find the scene of the wreck and they had learned from a whaler that some medals and a cross of st louis had been found in the hands of some savages of louisiade and new caledonia dumont durville commander of the astrolabe had then sailed and two months after dillon had left vanikoro he put into hobart town there he learned the results of dillons inquiries and found that a certain james hobbs second lieutenant of the union of calcutta after landing on an island situated   s lat and  0 e long had seen some iron bars and red stuffs used by the natives of these parts dumont durville much perplexed and not knowing how to credit the reports of lowclass journals decided to follow dillons track  on the 0th of february  the astrolabe appeared off tikopia and took as guide and interpreter a deserter found on the island made his way to vanikoro sighted it on the th inst lay among the reefs until the th and not until the 0th did he cast anchor within the barrier in the harbour of vanou  on the rd several officers went round the island and brought back some unimportant trifles  the natives adopting a system of denials and evasions refused to take them to the unlucky place this ambiguous conduct led them to believe that the natives had illtreated the castaways and indeed they seemed to fear that dumont durville had come to avenge la perouse and his unfortunate crew  however on the th appeased by some presents and understanding that they had no reprisals to fear they led m jacquireot to the scene of the wreck  there in three or four fathoms of water between the reefs of pacou and vanou lay anchors cannons pigs of lead and iron embedded in the limy concretions  the large boat and the whaler belonging to the astrolabe were sent to this place and not without some difficulty their crews hauled up an anchor weighing 00 lbs a brass gun some pigs of iron and two copper swivelguns  dumont durville questioning the natives learned too that la perouse after losing both his vessels on the reefs of this island had constructed a smaller boat only to be lost a second time where no one knew  but the french government fearing that dumont durville was not acquainted with dillons movements had sent the sloop bayonnaise commanded by legoarant de tromelin to vanikoro which had been stationed on the west coast of america the bayonnaise cast her anchor before vanikoro some months after the departure of the astrolabe but found no new document but stated that the savages had respected the monument to la perouse that is the substance of what i told captain nemo  so he said no one knows now where the third vessel perished that was constructed by the castaways on the island of vanikoro  no one knows  captain nemo said nothing but signed to me to follow him into the large saloon  the nautilus sank several yards below the waves and the panels were opened  i hastened to the aperture and under the crustations of coral covered with fungi i recognised certain debris that the drags had not been able to tear upiron stirrups anchors cannons bullets capstan fittings the stem of a ship all objects clearly proving the wreck of some vessel and now carpeted with living flowers while i was looking on this desolate scene captain nemo said in a sad voice  this above para was edited  commander la perouse set out th december  with his vessels la boussole and the astrolabe  he first cast anchor at botany bay visited the friendly isles new caledonia then directed his course towards santa cruz and put into namouka one of the hapai group then his vessels struck on the unknown reefs of vanikoro the boussole which went first ran aground on the southerly coast the astrolabe went to its help and ran aground too  the first vessel was destroyed almost immediately  the second stranded under the wind resisted some days  the natives made the castaways welcome they installed themselves in the island and constructed a smaller boat with the debris of the two large ones  some sailors stayed willingly at vanikoro the others weak and ill set out with la perouse they directed their course towards the solomon islands and there perished with everything on the westerly coast of the chief island of the group between capes deception and satisfaction  how do you know that  by this that i found on the spot where was the last wreck  captain nemo showed me a tinplate box stamped with the french arms and corroded by the salt water  he opened it and i saw a bundle of papers yellow but still readable  they were the instructions of the naval minister to commander la perouse annotated in the margin in louis xvis handwriting  ah it is a fine death for a sailor said captain nemo at last a coral tomb makes a quiet grave and i trust that i and my comrades will find no other    chapter xix  torres straits  during the night of the th or th of december the nautilus left the shores of vanikoro with great speed her course was southwesterly and in three days she had gone over the 0 leagues that separated it from la perouses group and the southeast point of papua  early on the st of january  conseil joined me on the platform  master will you permit me to wish you a happy new year  what  conseil exactly as if i was at paris in my study at the jardin des plantes  well i accept your good wishes and thank you for them  only i will ask you what you mean by a `happy new year under our circumstances  do you mean the year that will bring us to the end of our imprisonment or the year that sees us continue this strange voyage  really i do not know how to answer master  we are sure to see curious things and for the last two months we have not had time for dullness  the last marvel is always the most astonishing and if we continue this progression i do not know how it will end it is my opinion that we shall never again see the like i think then with no offence to master that a happy year would be one in which we could see everything  on nd january we had made 0 miles or 0 french leagues since our startingpoint in the japan seas before the ships head stretched the dangerous shores of the coral sea on the northeast coast of australia our boat lay along some miles from the redoubtable bank on which cooks vessel was lost 0th june 0  the boat in which cook was struck on a rock and if it did not sink it was owing to a piece of coral that was broken by the shock and fixed itself in the broken keel  i had wished to visit the reef 0 leagues long against which the sea always rough broke with great violence with a noise like thunder but just then the inclined planes drew the nautilus down to a great depth and i could see nothing of the high coral walls  i had to content myself with the different specimens of fish brought up by the nets i remarked among others some germons a species of mackerel as large as a tunny with bluish sides and striped with transverse bands that disappear with the animals life  these fish followed us in shoals and furnished us with very delicate food  we took also a large number of giltheads about one and a half inches long tasting like dorys and flying firefish like submarine swallows which in dark nights light alternately the air and water with their phosphorescent light sentences missing here  two days after crossing the coral sea th january we sighted the papuan coasts  on this occasion captain nemo informed me that his intention was to get into the indian ocean by the strait of torres his communication ended there  the torres straits are nearly thirtyfour leagues wide but they are obstructed by an innumerable quantity of islands islets breakers and rocks that make its navigation almost impracticable so that captain nemo took all needful precautions to cross them the nautilus floating betwixt wind and water went at a moderate pace her screw like a cetaceans tail beat the waves slowly  profiting by this i and my two companions went up on to the deserted platform  before us was the steersmans cage and i expected that captain nemo was there directing the course of the nautilus i had before me the excellent charts of the straits of torres and i consulted them attentively  round the nautilus the sea dashed furiously the course of the waves that went from southeast to northwest at the rate of two and a half miles broke on the coral that showed itself here and there  this is a bad sea remarked ned land  detestable indeed and one that does not suit a boat like the nautilus  the captain must be very sure of his route for i see there pieces of coral that would do for its keel if it only touched them slightly  indeed the situation was dangerous but the nautilus seemed to slide like magic off these rocks  it did not follow the routes of the astrolabe and the zelee exactly for they proved fatal to dumont durville it bore more northwards coasted the islands of murray and came back to the southwest towards cumberland passage i thought it was going to pass it by when going back to northwest it went through a large quantity of islands and islets little known towards the island sound and canal mauvais  i wondered if captain nemo foolishly imprudent would steer his vessel into that pass where dumont durvilles two corvettes touched when swerving again and cutting straight through to the west he steered for the island of gilboa  it was then three in the afternoon  the tide began to recede being quite full  the nautilus approached the island that i still saw with its remarkable border of screwpines he stood off it at about two miles distant  suddenly a shock overthrew me the nautilus just touched a rock and stayed immovable laying lightly to port side  when i rose i perceived captain nemo and his lieutenant on the platform they were examining the situation of the vessel and exchanging words in their incomprehensible dialect  she was situated thus  two miles on the starboard side appeared gilboa stretching from north to west like an immense arm towards the south and east some coral showed itself left by the ebb we had run aground and in one of those seas where the tides are middlinga sorry matter for the floating of the nautilus however the vessel had not suffered for her keel was solidly joined but if she could neither glide off nor move she ran the risk of being for ever fastened to these rocks and then captain nemos submarine vessel would be done for  i was reflecting thus when the captain cool and calm always master of himself approached me  an accident  i asked  no an incident  but an incident that will oblige you perhaps to become an inhabitant of this land from which you flee  captain nemo looked at me curiously and made a negative gesture as much as to say that nothing would force him to set foot on terra firma again then he said  besides m aronnax the nautilus is not lost it will carry you yet into the midst of the marvels of the ocean our voyage is only begun and i do not wish to be deprived so soon of the honour of your company  however captain nemo i replied without noticing the ironical turn of his phrase the nautilus ran aground in open sea now the tides are not strong in the pacific and if you cannot lighten the nautilus i do not see how it will be reinflated  the tides are not strong in the pacific  you are right there professor but in torres straits one finds still a difference of a yard and a half between the level of high and low seas today is th january and in five days the moon will be full now i shall be very much astonished if that satellite does not raise these masses of water sufficiently and render me a service that i should be indebted to her for  having said this captain nemo followed by his lieutenant redescended to the interior of the nautilus  as to the vessel it moved not and was immovable as if the coralline polypi had already walled it up with their in destructible cement  well sir said ned land who came up to me after the departure of the captain  well friend ned we will wait patiently for the tide on the th instant for it appears that the moon will have the goodness to put it off again  really  really  and this captain is not going to cast anchor at all since the tide will suffice said conseil simply  the canadian looked at conseil then shrugged his shoulders  sir you may believe me when i tell you that this piece of iron will navigate neither on nor under the sea again it is only fit to be sold for its weight i think therefore that the time has come to part company with captain nemo  friend ned i do not despair of this stout nautilus as you do and in four days we shall know what to hold to on the pacific tides besides flight might be possible if we were in sight of the english or provencal coast but on the papuan shores it is another thing and it will be time enough to come to that extremity if the nautilus does not recover itself again which i look upon as a grave event  but do they know at least how to act circumspectly  there is an island on that island there are trees under those trees terrestrial animals bearers of cutlets and roast beef to which i would willingly give a trial  in this friend ned is right said conseil and i agree with him could not master obtain permission from his friend captain nemo to put us on land if only so as not to lose the habit of treading on the solid parts of our planet  i can ask him but he will refuse  will master risk it asked conseil and we shall know how to rely upon the captains amiability  to my great surprise captain nemo gave me the permission i asked for and he gave it very agreeably without even exacting from me a promise to return to the vessel but flight across new guinea might be very perilous and i should not have counselled ned land to attempt it better to be a prisoner on board the nautilus than to fall into the hands of the natives  at eight oclock armed with guns and hatchets we got off the nautilus the sea was pretty calm a slight breeze blew on land conseil and i rowing we sped along quickly and ned steered in the straight passage that the breakers left between them the boat was well handled and moved rapidly  ned land could not restrain his joy  he was like a prisoner that had escaped from prison and knew not that it was necessary to reenter it  meat  we are going to eat some meat and what meat he replied real game no bread indeed  i do not say that fish is not good we must not abuse it but a piece of fresh venison grilled on live coals will agreeably vary our ordinary course  glutton said conseil he makes my mouth water  it remains to be seen i said if these forests are full of game and if the game is not such as will hunt the hunter himself  well said m aronnax replied the canadian whose teeth seemed sharpened like the edge of a hatchet but i will eat tiger loin of tigerif there is no other quadruped on this island  friend ned is uneasy about it said conseil  whatever it may be continued ned land every animal with four paws without feathers or with two paws without feathers will be saluted by my first shot  very well  master lands imprudences are beginning  never fear m aronnax replied the canadian i do not want twentyfive minutes to offer you a dish of my sort  at halfpast eight the nautilus boat ran softly aground on a heavy sand after having happily passed the coral reef that surrounds the island of gilboa    chapter xx  a few days on land  i was much impressed on touching land  ned land tried the soil with his feet as if to take possession of it however it was only two months before that we had become according to captain nemo passengers on board the nautilus but in reality prisoners of its commander  in a few minutes we were within musketshot of the coast the whole horizon was hidden behind a beautiful curtain of forests enormous trees the trunks of which attained a height of 00 feet were tied to each other by garlands of bindweed real natural hammocks which a light breeze rocked  they were mimosas figs hibisci and palm trees mingled together in profusion and under the shelter of their verdant vault grew orchids leguminous plants and ferns  but without noticing all these beautiful specimens of papuan flora the canadian abandoned the agreeable for the useful he discovered a cocotree beat down some of the fruit broke them and we drunk the milk and ate the nut with a satisfaction that protested against the ordinary food on the nautilus  excellent said ned land  exquisite replied conseil  and i do not think said the canadian that he would object to our introducing a cargo of coconuts on board  i do not think he would but he would not taste them  so much the worse for him said conseil  and so much the better for us replied ned land there will be more for us  one word only master land i said to the harpooner who was beginning to ravage another coconut tree  coconuts are good things but before filling the canoe with them it would be wise to reconnoitre and see if the island does not produce some substance not less useful fresh vegetables would be welcome on board the nautilus  master is right replied conseil and i propose to reserve three places in our vessel one for fruits the other for vegetables and the third for the venison of which i have not yet seen the smallest specimen  conseil we must not despair said the canadian  let us continue i returned and lie in wait  although the island seems uninhabited it might still contain some individuals that would be less hard than we on the nature of game  ho ho said ned land moving his jaws significantly  well ned said conseil  my word returned the canadian i begin to understand the charms of anthropophagy  ned  ned what are you saying  you a maneater i should not feel safe with you especially as i share your cabin i might perhaps wake one day to find myself half devoured  friend conseil i like you much but not enough to eat you unnecessarily  i would not trust you replied conseil  but enough we must absolutely bring down some game to satisfy this cannibal or else one of these fine mornings master will find only pieces of his servant to serve him  while we were talking thus we were penetrating the sombre arches of the forest and for two hours we surveyed it in all directions  chance rewarded our search for eatable vegetables and one of the most useful products of the tropical zones furnished us with precious food that we missed on board i would speak of the breadfruit tree very abundant in the island of gilboa and i remarked chiefly the variety destitute of seeds which bears in malaya the name of rima  ned land knew these fruits well  he had already eaten many during his numerous voyages and he knew how to prepare the eatable substance moreover the sight of them excited him and he could contain himself no longer  master he said i shall die if i do not taste a little of this breadfruit pie  taste it friend nedtaste it as you want  we are here to make experimentsmake them  it wont take long said the canadian  and provided with a lentil he lighted a fire of dead wood that crackled joyously  during this time conseil and i chose the best fruits of the breadfruit some had not then attained a sufficient degree of maturity and their thick skin covered a white but rather fibrous pulp  others the greater number yellow and gelatinous waited only to be picked  these fruits enclosed no kernel  conseil brought a dozen to ned land who placed them on a coal fire after having cut them in thick slices and while doing this repeating  you will see master how good this bread is more so when one has been deprived of it so long it is not even bread added he but a delicate pastry you have eaten none master  no ned  very well prepare yourself for a juicy thing  if you do not come for more i am no longer the king of harpooners  after some minutes the part of the fruits that was exposed to the fire was completely roasted  the interior looked like a white pasty a sort of soft crumb the flavour of which was like that of an artichoke  it must be confessed this bread was excellent and i ate of it with great relish  what time is it now asked the canadian  two oclock at least replied conseil  how time flies on firm ground sighed ned land  let us be off replied conseil  we returned through the forest and completed our collection by a raid upon the cabbagepalms that we gathered from the tops of the trees little beans that i recognised as the abrou of the malays and yams of a superior quality  we were loaded when we reached the boat  but ned land did not find his provisions sufficient  fate however favoured us just as we were pushing off he perceived several trees from twentyfive to thirty feet high a species of palmtree  at last at five oclock in the evening loaded with our riches we quitted the shore and half an hour after we hailed the nautilus no one appeared on our arrival  the enormous ironplated cylinder seemed deserted  the provisions embarked i descended to my chamber and after supper slept soundly  the next day th january nothing new on board not a sound inside not a sign of life  the boat rested along the edge in the same place in which we had left it we resolved to return to the island  ned land hoped to be more fortunate than on the day before with regard to the hunt and wished to visit another part of the forest  at dawn we set off  the boat carried on by the waves that flowed to shore reached the island in a few minutes  we landed and thinking that it was better to give in to the canadian we followed ned land whose long limbs threatened to distance us he wound up the coast towards the west  then fording some torrents he gained the high plain that was bordered with admirable forests some kingfishers were rambling along the watercourses but they would not let themselves be approached  their circumspection proved to me that these birds knew what to expect from bipeds of our species and i concluded that if the island was not inhabited at least human beings occasionally frequented it  after crossing a rather large prairie we arrived at the skirts of a little wood that was enlivened by the songs and flight of a large number of birds  there are only birds said conseil  but they are eatable replied the harpooner  i do not agree with you friend ned for i see only parrots there  friend conseil said ned gravely the parrot is like pheasant to those who have nothing else  and i added this bird suitably prepared is worth knife and fork  indeed under the thick foliage of this wood a world of parrots were flying from branch to branch only needing a careful education to speak the human language  for the moment they were chattering with parrots of all colours and grave cockatoos who seemed to meditate upon some philosophical problem whilst brilliant red lories passed like a piece of bunting carried away by the breeze papuans with the finest azure colours and in all a variety of winged things most charming to behold but few eatable  however a bird peculiar to these lands and which has never passed the limits of the arrow and papuan islands was wanting in this collection but fortune reserved it for me before long  after passing through a moderately thick copse we found a plain obstructed with bushes  i saw then those magnificent birds the disposition of whose long feathers obliges them to fly against the wind  their undulating flight graceful aerial curves and the shading of their colours attracted and charmed ones looks i had no trouble in recognising them  birds of paradise  i exclaimed  the malays who carry on a great trade in these birds with the chinese have several means that we could not employ for taking them sometimes they put snares on the top of high trees that the birds of paradise prefer to frequent  sometimes they catch them with a viscous birdlime that paralyses their movements  they even go so far as to poison the fountains that the birds generally drink from but we were obliged to fire at them during flight which gave us few chances to bring them down and indeed we vainly exhausted one half our ammunition  about eleven oclock in the morning the first range of mountains that form the centre of the island was traversed and we had killed nothing hunger drove us on  the hunters had relied on the products of the chase and they were wrong  happily conseil to his great surprise made a double shot and secured breakfast  he brought down a white pigeon and a woodpigeon which cleverly plucked and suspended from a skewer was roasted before a red fire of dead wood  while these interesting birds were cooking ned prepared the fruit of the breadtree then the woodpigeons were devoured to the bones and declared excellent the nutmeg with which they are in the habit of stuffing their crops flavours their flesh and renders it delicious eating  now ned what do you miss now  some fourfooted game m aronnax  all these pigeons are only sidedishes and trifles and until i have killed an animal with cutlets i shall not be content  nor i ned if i do not catch a bird of paradise  let us continue hunting replied conseil  let us go towards the sea we have arrived at the first declivities of the mountains and i think we had better regain the region of forests  that was sensible advice and was followed out after walking for one hour we had attained a forest of sagotrees some inoffensive serpents glided away from us the birds of paradise fled at our approach and truly i despaired of getting near one when conseil who was walking in front suddenly bent down uttered a triumphal cry and came back to me bringing a magnificent specimen  ah bravo conseil  master is very good  no my boy you have made an excellent stroke take one of these living birds and carry it in your hand  if master will examine it he will see that i have not deserved great merit  why conseil  because this bird is as drunk as a quail  drunk  yes sir drunk with the nutmegs that it devoured under the nutmegtree under which i found it  see friend ned see the monstrous effects of intemperance  by jove exclaimed the canadian because i have drunk gin for two months you must needs reproach me  however i examined the curious bird  conseil was right the bird drunk with the juice was quite powerless  it could not fly it could hardly walk  this bird belonged to the most beautiful of the eight species that are found in papua and in the neighbouring islands it was the large emerald bird the most rare kind it measured three feet in length  its head was comparatively small its eyes placed near the opening of the beak and also small but the shades of colour were beautiful having a yellow beak brown feet and claws nutcoloured wings with purple tips pale yellow at the back of the neck and head and emerald colour at the throat chestnut on the breast and belly two horned downy nets rose from below the tail that prolonged the long light feathers of admirable fineness and they completed the whole of this marvellous bird that the natives have poetically named the bird of the sun  but if my wishes were satisfied by the possession of the bird of paradise the canadians were not yet  happily about two oclock ned land brought down a magnificent hog from the brood of those the natives call barioutang the animal came in time for us to procure real quadruped meat and he was well received ned land was very proud of his shot  the hog hit by the electric ball fell stone dead  the canadian skinned and cleaned it properly after having taken half a dozen cutlets destined to furnish us with a grilled repast in the evening  then the hunt was resumed which was still more marked by ned and conseils exploits  indeed the two friends beating the bushes roused a herd of kangaroos that fled and bounded along on their elastic paws but these animals did not take to flight so rapidly but what the electric capsule could stop their course  ah professor cried ned land who was carried away by the delights of the chase what excellent game and stewed too what a supply for the nautilus  two three five down and to think that we shall eat that flesh and that the idiots on board shall not have a crumb  i think that in the excess of his joy the canadian if he had not talked so much would have killed them all but he contented himself with a single dozen of these interesting marsupians  these animals were small they were a species of those kangaroo rabbits that live habitually in the hollows of trees and whose speed is extreme but they are moderately fat and furnish at least estimable food we were very satisfied with the results of the hunt happy ned proposed to return to this enchanting island the next day for he wished to depopulate it of all the eatable quadrupeds but he had reckoned without his host  at six oclock in the evening we had regained the shore our boat was moored to the usual place  the nautilus like a long rock emerged from the waves two miles from the beach ned land without waiting occupied himself about the important dinner business  he understood all about cooking well the barioutang grilled on the coals soon scented the air with a delicious odour  indeed the dinner was excellent  two woodpigeons completed this extraordinary menu  the sago pasty the artocarpus bread some mangoes half a dozen pineapples and the liquor fermented from some coconuts overjoyed us i even think that my worthy companions ideas had not all the plainness desirable  suppose we do not return to the nautilus this evening said conseil  suppose we never return added ned land  just then a stone fell at our feet and cut short the harpooners proposition    chapter xxi  captain nemos thunderbolt  we looked at the edge of the forest without rising my hand stopping in the action of putting it to my mouth ned lands completing its office  stones do not fall from the sky remarked conseil or they would merit the name aerolites  a second stone carefully aimed that made a savoury pigeons leg fall from conseils hand gave still more weight to his observation we all three arose shouldered our guns and were ready to reply to any attack  are they apes cried ned land  very nearlythey are savages  to the boat  i said hurrying to the sea  it was indeed necessary to beat a retreat for about twenty natives armed with bows and slings appeared on the skirts of a copse that masked the horizon to the right hardly a hundred steps from us  our boat was moored about sixty feet from us  the savages approached us not running but making hostile demonstrations stones and arrows fell thickly  ned land had not wished to leave his provisions and in spite of his imminent danger his pig on one side and kangaroos on the other he went tolerably fast  in two minutes we were on the shore to load the boat with provisions and arms to push it out to sea and ship the oars was the work of an instant we had not gone two cablelengths when a hundred savages howling and gesticulating entered the water up to their waists i watched to see if their apparition would attract some men from the nautilus on to the platform  but no  the enormous machine lying off was absolutely deserted  twenty minutes later we were on board  the panels were open after making the boat fast we entered into the interior of the nautilus  i descended to the drawingroom from whence i heard some chords captain nemo was there bending over his organ and plunged in a musical ecstasy  captain  he did not hear me  captain  i said touching his hand  he shuddered and turning round said ah it is you professor well have you had a good hunt have you botanised successfully  yes captain but we have unfortunately brought a troop of bipeds whose vicinity troubles me  what bipeds  savages  savages he echoed ironically  so you are astonished professor at having set foot on a strange land and finding savages savages where are there not any  besides are they worse than others these whom you call savages  but captain  how many have you counted  a hundred at least  m aronnax replied captain nemo placing his fingers on the organ stops when all the natives of papua are assembled on this shore the nautilus will have nothing to fear from their attacks  the captains fingers were then running over the keys of the instrument and i remarked that he touched only the black keys which gave his melodies an essentially scotch character soon he had forgotten my presence and had plunged into a reverie that i did not disturb  i went up again on to the platform night had already fallen for in this low latitude the sun sets rapidly and without twilight  i could only see the island indistinctly but the numerous fires lighted on the beach showed that the natives did not think of leaving it i was alone for several hours sometimes thinking of the natives but without any dread of them for the imperturbable confidence of the captain was catchingsometimes forgetting them to admire the splendours of the night in the tropics my remembrances went to france in the train of those zodiacal stars that would shine in some hours time  the moon shone in the midst of the constellations of the zenith  the night slipped away without any mischance the islanders frightened no doubt at the sight of a monster aground in the bay the panels were open and would have offered an easy access to the interior of the nautilus  at six oclock in the morning of the th january i went up on to the platform  the dawn was breaking  the island soon showed itself through the dissipating fogs first the shore then the summits  the natives were there more numerous than on the day before five or six hundred perhapssome of them profiting by the low water had come on to the coral at less than two cablelengths from the nautilus i distinguished them easily they were true papuans with athletic figures men of good race large high foreheads large but not broad and flat and white teeth  their woolly hair with a reddish tinge showed off on their black shining bodies like those of the nubians  from the lobes of their ears cut and distended hung chaplets of bones  most of these savages were naked amongst them i remarked some women dressed from the hips to knees in quite a crinoline of herbs that sustained a vegetable waistband some chiefs had ornamented their necks with a crescent and collars of glass beads red and white nearly all were armed with bows arrows and shields and carried on their shoulders a sort of net containing those round stones which they cast from their slings with great skill one of these chiefs rather near to the nautilus examined it attentively he was perhaps a mado of high rank for he was draped in a mat of bananaleaves notched round the edges and set off with brilliant colours  i could easily have knocked down this native who was within a short length but i thought that it was better to wait for real hostile demonstrations between europeans and savages it is proper for the europeans to parry sharply not to attack  during low water the natives roamed about near the nautilus but were not troublesome i heard them frequently repeat the word assai and by their gestures i understood that they invited me to go on land an invitation that i declined  so that on that day the boat did not push off to the great displeasure of master land who could not complete his provisions  this adroit canadian employed his time in preparing the viands and meat that he had brought off the island  as for the savages they returned to the shore about eleven oclock in the morning as soon as the coral tops began to disappear under the rising tide but i saw their numbers had increased considerably on the shore probably they came from the neighbouring islands or very likely from papua  however i had not seen a single native canoe having nothing better to do i thought of dragging these beautiful limpid waters under which i saw a profusion of shells zoophytes and marine plants  moreover it was the last day that the nautilus would pass in these parts if it float in open sea the next day according to captain nemos promise  i therefore called conseil who brought me a little light drag very like those for the oyster fishery  now to work for two hours we fished unceasingly but without bringing up any rarities  the drag was filled with midasears harps melames and particularly the most beautiful hammers i have ever seen we also brought up some seaslugs pearloysters and a dozen little turtles that were reserved for the pantry on board  but just when i expected it least i put my hand on a wonder i might say a natural deformity very rarely met with conseil was just dragging and his net came up filled with divers ordinary shells when all at once he saw me plunge my arm quickly into the net to draw out a shell and heard me utter a cry  what is the matter sir he asked in surprise has master been bitten  no my boy but i would willingly have given a finger for my discovery  what discovery  this shell i said holding up the object of my triumph  it is simply an olive porphyry  genus species missing  yes conseil but instead of being rolled from right to left this olive turns from left to right  is it possible  yes my boy it is a left shell  shells are all righthanded with rare exceptions and when by chance their spiral is left amateurs are ready to pay their weight in gold  conseil and i were absorbed in the contemplation of our treasure and i was promising myself to enrich the museum with it when a stone unfortunately thrown by a native struck against and broke the precious object in conseils hand i uttered a cry of despair  conseil took up his gun and aimed at a savage who was poising his sling at ten yards from him i would have stopped him but his blow took effect and broke the bracelet of amulets which encircled the arm of the savage  conseil cried i conseil  well sir do you not see that the cannibal has commenced the attack  a shell is not worth the life of a man said i  ah the scoundrel cried conseil i would rather he had broken my shoulder  conseil was in earnest but i was not of his opinion  however the situation had changed some minutes before and we had not perceived  a score of canoes surrounded the nautilus  these canoes scooped out of the trunk of a tree long narrow well adapted for speed were balanced by means of a long bamboo pole which floated on the water  they were managed by skilful halfnaked paddlers and i watched their advance with some uneasiness it was evident that these papuans had already had dealings with the europeans and knew their ships  but this long iron cylinder anchored in the bay without masts or chimneys what could they think of it  nothing good for at first they kept at a respectful distance  however seeing it motionless by degrees they took courage and sought to familiarise themselves with it now this familiarity was precisely what it was necessary to avoid our arms which were noiseless could only produce a moderate effect on the savages who have little respect for aught but blustering things the thunderbolt without the reverberations of thunder would frighten man but little though the danger lies in the lightning not in the noise  at this moment the canoes approached the nautilus and a shower of arrows alighted on her  i went down to the saloon but found no one there  i ventured to knock at the door that opened into the captains room come in was the answer  i entered and found captain nemo deep in algebraical calculations of x and other quantities  i am disturbing you said i for courtesys sake  that is true m aronnax replied the captain but i think you have serious reasons for wishing to see me  very grave ones the natives are surrounding us in their canoes and in a few minutes we shall certainly be attacked by many hundreds of savages  ah said captain nemo quietly they are come with their canoes  yes sir  well sir we must close the hatches  exactly and i came to say to you  nothing can be more simple said captain nemo  and pressing an electric button he transmitted an order to the ships crew  it is all done sir said he after some moments the pinnace is ready and the hatches are closed you do not fear i imagine that these gentlemen could stave in walls on which the balls of your frigate have had no effect  no captain but a danger still exists  what is that sir  it is that tomorrow at about this hour we must open the hatches to renew the air of the nautilus  now if at this moment the papuans should occupy the platform i do not see how you could prevent them from entering  then sir you suppose that they will board us  i am certain of it  well sir let them come  i see no reason for hindering them after all these papuans are poor creatures and i am unwilling that my visit to the island should cost the life of a single one of these wretches  upon that i was going away but captain nemo detained me and asked me to sit down by him  he questioned me with interest about our excursions on shore and our hunting and seemed not to understand the craving for meat that possessed the canadian then the conversation turned on various subjects and without being more communicative captain nemo showed himself more amiable  amongst other things we happened to speak of the situation of the nautilus run aground in exactly the same spot in this strait where dumont durville was nearly lost apropos of this  this durville was one of your great sailors said the captain to me one of your most intelligent navigators  he is the captain cook of you frenchmen  unfortunate man of science after having braved the icebergs of the south pole the coral reefs of oceania the cannibals of the pacific to perish miserably in a railway train if this energetic man could have reflected during the last moments of his life what must have been uppermost in his last thoughts do you suppose  so speaking captain nemo seemed moved and his emotion gave me a better opinion of him  then chart in hand we reviewed the travels of the french navigator his voyages of circumnavigation his double detention at the south pole which led to the discovery of adelaide and louis philippe and fixing the hydrographical bearings of the principal islands of oceania  that which your durville has done on the surface of the seas said captain nemo that have i done under them and more easily more completely than he the astrolabe and the zelee incessantly tossed about by the hurricane could not be worth the nautilus quiet repository of labour that she is truly motionless in the midst of the waters  tomorrow added the captain rising tomorrow at twenty minutes to three pm the nautilus shall float and leave the strait of torres uninjured  having curtly pronounced these words captain nemo bowed slightly this was to dismiss me and i went back to my room  there i found conseil who wished to know the result of my interview with the captain  my boy said i when i feigned to believe that his nautilus was threatened by the natives of papua the captain answered me very sarcastically  i have but one thing to say to you have confidence in him and go to sleep in peace  have you no need of my services sir  no my friend  what is ned land doing  if you will excuse me sir answered conseil friend ned is busy making a kangaroopie which will be a marvel  i remained alone and went to bed but slept indifferently  i heard the noise of the savages who stamped on the platform uttering deafening cries the night passed thus without disturbing the ordinary repose of the crew the presence of these cannibals affected them no more than the soldiers of a masked battery care for the ants that crawl over its front  at six in the morning i rose  the hatches had not been opened the inner air was not renewed but the reservoirs filled ready for any emergency were now resorted to and discharged several cubic feet of oxygen into the exhausted atmosphere of the nautilus  i worked in my room till noon without having seen captain nemo even for an instant  on board no preparations for departure were visible  i waited still some time then went into the large saloon the clock marked halfpast two  in ten minutes it would be hightide and if captain nemo had not made a rash promise the nautilus would be immediately detached  if not many months would pass ere she could leave her bed of coral  however some warning vibrations began to be felt in the vessel i heard the keel grating against the rough calcareous bottom of the coral reef  at fiveandtwenty minutes to three captain nemo appeared in the saloon  we are going to start said he  ah replied i  i have given the order to open the hatches  and the papuans  the papuans answered captain nemo slightly shrugging his shoulders  will they not come inside the nautilus  how  only by leaping over the hatches you have opened  m aronnax quietly answered captain nemo they will not enter the hatches of the nautilus in that way even if they were open  i looked at the captain  you do not understand said he  hardly  well come and you will see  i directed my steps towards the central staircase  there ned land and conseil were slyly watching some of the ships crew who were opening the hatches while cries of rage and fearful vociferations resounded outside  the port lids were pulled down outside  twenty horrible faces appeared but the first native who placed his hand on the stairrail struck from behind by some invisible force i know not what fled uttering the most fearful cries and making the wildest contortions  ten of his companions followed him  they met with the same fate  conseil was in ecstasy  ned land carried away by his violent instincts rushed on to the staircase  but the moment he seized the rail with both hands he in his turn was overthrown  i am struck by a thunderbolt cried he with an oath  this explained all  it was no rail but a metallic cable charged with electricity from the deck communicating with the platform  whoever touched it felt a powerful shock and this shock would have been mortal if captain nemo had discharged into the conductor the whole force of the current it might truly be said that between his assailants and himself he had stretched a network of electricity which none could pass with impunity  meanwhile the exasperated papuans had beaten a retreat paralysed with terror  as for us half laughing we consoled and rubbed the unfortunate ned land who swore like one possessed  but at this moment the nautilus raised by the last waves of the tide quitted her coral bed exactly at the fortieth minute fixed by the captain  her screw swept the waters slowly and majestically her speed increased gradually and sailing on the surface of the ocean she quitted safe and sound the dangerous passes of the straits of torres    chapter xxii  aegri somnia  the following day 0th january the nautilus continued her course between two seas but with such remarkable speed that i could not estimate it at less than thirtyfive miles an hour the rapidity of her screw was such that i could neither follow nor count its revolutions  when i reflected that this marvellous electric agent after having afforded motion heat and light to the nautilus still protected her from outward attack and transformed her into an ark of safety which no profane hand might touch without being thunderstricken my admiration was unbounded and from the structure it extended to the engineer who had called it into existence  our course was directed to the west and on the th of january we doubled cape wessel situation in  long  and 0 s lat which forms the east point of the gulf of carpentaria  the reefs were still numerous but more equalised and marked on the chart with extreme precision the nautilus easily avoided the breakers of money to port and the victoria reefs to starboard placed at 0 long  and on the 0th parallel which we strictly followed  on the th of january captain nemo arrived in the sea of timor and recognised the island of that name in  long  from this point the direction of the nautilus inclined towards the southwest her head was set for the indian ocean where would the fancy of captain nemo carry us next would he return to the coast of asia or would he approach again the shores of europe  improbable conjectures both to a man who fled from inhabited continents  then would he descend to the south  was he going to double the cape of good hope then cape horn and finally go as far as the antarctic pole  would he come back at last to the pacific where his nautilus could sail free and independently time would show  after having skirted the sands of cartier of hibernia seringapatam and scott last efforts of the solid against the liquid element on the th of january we lost sight of land altogether the speed of the nautilus was considerably abated and with irregular course she sometimes swam in the bosom of the waters sometimes floated on their surface  during this period of the voyage captain nemo made some interesting experiments on the varied temperature of the sea in different beds under ordinary conditions these observations are made by means of rather complicated instruments and with somewhat doubtful results by means of thermometrical soundingleads the glasses often breaking under the pressure of the water or an apparatus grounded on the variations of the resistance of metals to the electric currents results so obtained could not be correctly calculated  on the contrary captain nemo went himself to test the temperature in the depths of the sea and his thermometer placed in communication with the different sheets of water gave him the required degree immediately and accurately  it was thus that either by overloading her reservoirs or by descending obliquely by means of her inclined planes the nautilus successively attained the depth of three four five seven nine and ten thousand yards and the definite result of this experience was that the sea preserved an average temperature of four degrees and a half at a depth of five thousand fathoms under all latitudes  on the th of january the nautilus seemed becalmed only a few yards beneath the surface of the waves her electric apparatus remained inactive and her motionless screw left her to drift at the mercy of the currents i supposed that the crew was occupied with interior repairs rendered necessary by the violence of the mechanical movements of the machine  my companions and i then witnessed a curious spectacle the hatches of the saloon were open and as the beacon light of the nautilus was not in action a dim obscurity reigned in the midst of the waters  i observed the state of the sea under these conditions and the largest fish appeared to me no more than scarcely defined shadows when the nautilus found herself suddenly transported into full light i thought at first that the beacon had been lighted and was casting its electric radiance into the liquid mass i was mistaken and after a rapid survey perceived my error  the nautilus floated in the midst of a phosphorescent bed which in this obscurity became quite dazzling  it was produced by myriads of luminous animalculae whose brilliancy was increased as they glided over the metallic hull of the vessel i was surprised by lightning in the midst of these luminous sheets as though they bad been rivulets of lead melted in an ardent furnace or metallic masses brought to a white heat so that by force of contrast certain portions of light appeared to cast a shade in the midst of the general ignition from which all shade seemed banished  no this was not the calm irradiation of our ordinary lightning  there was unusual life and vigour this was truly living light  in reality it was an infinite agglomeration of coloured infusoria of veritable globules of jelly provided with a threadlike tentacle and of which as many as twentyfive thousand have been counted in less than two cubic halfinches of water  during several hours the nautilus floated in these brilliant waves and our admiration increased as we watched the marine monsters disporting themselves like salamanders  i saw there in the midst of this fire that burns not the swift and elegant porpoise the indefatigable clown of the ocean and some swordfish ten feet long those prophetic heralds of the hurricane whose formidable sword would now and then strike the glass of the saloon then appeared the smaller fish the balista the leaping mackerel wolfthorntails and a hundred others which striped the luminous atmosphere as they swam  this dazzling spectacle was enchanting perhaps some atmospheric condition increased the intensity of this phenomenon  perhaps some storm agitated the surface of the waves but at this depth of some yards the nautilus was unmoved by its fury and reposed peacefully in still water  so we progressed incessantly charmed by some new marvel the days passed rapidly away and i took no account of them ned according to habit tried to vary the diet on board like snails we were fixed to our shells and i declare it is easy to lead a snails life  thus this life seemed easy and natural and we thought no longer of the life we led on land but something happened to recall us to the strangeness of our situation  on the th of january the nautilus was in 0 long and  s lat  the weather was threatening the sea rough and rolling  there was a strong east wind  the barometer which had been going down for some days foreboded a coming storm i went up on to the platform just as the second lieutenant was taking the measure of the horary angles and waited according to habit till the daily phrase was said  but on this day it was exchanged for another phrase not less incomprehensible almost directly i saw captain nemo appear with a glass looking towards the horizon  for some minutes he was immovable without taking his eye off the point of observation  then he lowered his glass and exchanged a few words with his lieutenant  the latter seemed to be a victim to some emotion that he tried in vain to repress captain nemo having more command over himself was cool he seemed too to be making some objections to which the lieutenant replied by formal assurances  at least i concluded so by the difference of their tones and gestures  for myself i had looked carefully in the direction indicated without seeing anything the sky and water were lost in the clear line of the horizon  however captain nemo walked from one end of the platform to the other without looking at me perhaps without seeing me his step was firm but less regular than usual he stopped sometimes crossed his arms and observed the sea what could he be looking for on that immense expanse  the nautilus was then some hundreds of miles from the nearest coast  the lieutenant had taken up the glass and examined the horizon steadfastly going and coming stamping his foot and showing more nervous agitation than his superior officer  besides this mystery must necessarily be solved and before long for upon an order from captain nemo the engine increasing its propelling power made the screw turn more rapidly  just then the lieutenant drew the captains attention again the latter stopped walking and directed his glass towards the place indicated  he looked long  i felt very much puzzled and descended to the drawingroom and took out an excellent telescope that i generally used  then leaning on the cage of the watchlight that jutted out from the front of the platform set myself to look over all the line of the sky and sea  but my eye was no sooner applied to the glass than it was quickly snatched out of my hands  i turned round  captain nemo was before me but i did not know him his face was transfigured  his eyes flashed sullenly his teeth were set his stiff body clenched fists and head shrunk between his shoulders betrayed the violent agitation that pervaded his whole frame he did not move  my glass fallen from his hands had rolled at his feet  had i unwittingly provoked this fit of anger  did this incomprehensible person imagine that i had discovered some forbidden secret no i was not the object of this hatred for he was not looking at me his eye was steadily fixed upon the impenetrable point of the horizon at last captain nemo recovered himself  his agitation subsided he addressed some words in a foreign language to his lieutenant then turned to me  m aronnax he said in rather an imperious tone i require you to keep one of the conditions that bind you to me  what is it captain  you must be confined with your companions until i think fit to release you  you are the master i replied looking steadily at him but may i ask you one question  none sir  there was no resisting this imperious command it would have been useless i went down to the cabin occupied by ned land and conseil and told them the captains determination  you may judge how this communication was received by the canadian  but there was not time for altercation  four of the crew waited at the door and conducted us to that cell where we had passed our first night on board the nautilus  ned land would have remonstrated but the door was shut upon him  will master tell me what this means asked conseil  i told my companions what had passed  they were as much astonished as i and equally at a loss how to account for it  meanwhile i was absorbed in my own reflections and could think of nothing but the strange fear depicted in the captains countenance i was utterly at a loss to account for it when my cogitations were disturbed by these words from ned land  hallo breakfast is ready  and indeed the table was laid  evidently captain nemo had given this order at the same time that he had hastened the speed of the nautilus  will master permit me to make a recommendation asked conseil  yes my boy  well it is that master breakfasts  it is prudent for we do not know what may happen  you are right conseil  unfortunately said ned land they have only given us the ships fare  friend ned asked conseil what would you have said if the breakfast had been entirely forgotten  this argument cut short the harpooners recriminations  we sat down to table  the meal was eaten in silence  just then the luminous globe that lighted the cell went out and left us in total darkness  ned land was soon asleep and what astonished me was that conseil went off into a heavy slumber  i was thinking what could have caused his irresistible drowsiness when i felt my brain becoming stupefied in spite of my efforts to keep my eyes open they would close a painful suspicion seized me  evidently soporific substances had been mixed with the food we had just taken  imprisonment was not enough to conceal captain nemos projects from us sleep was more necessary i then heard the panels shut  the undulations of the sea which caused a slight rolling motion ceased  had the nautilus quitted the surface of the ocean  had it gone back to the motionless bed of water i tried to resist sleep  it was impossible  my breathing grew weak i felt a mortal cold freeze my stiffened and halfparalysed limbs my eye lids like leaden caps fell over my eyes  i could not raise them a morbid sleep full of hallucinations bereft me of my being then the visions disappeared and left me in complete insensibility    chapter xxiii  the coral kingdom  the next day i woke with my head singularly clear to my great surprise i was in my own room  my companions no doubt had been reinstated in their cabin without having perceived it any more than i of what had passed during the night they were as ignorant as i was and to penetrate this mystery i only reckoned upon the chances of the future
